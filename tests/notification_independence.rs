//! The notification-independence invariant: a liveness read is never a
//! precondition for, and never a side effect on, a write. The journal an actor
//! produces is byte-identical whether or not anyone reads its liveness, and a
//! change signal that is computed and then dropped neither un-writes nor fails
//! the durable write. This is the guarantee that keeps the attention layer from
//! sliding into executive control: the core emits the change fact (the token)
//! but never delivers it, and nothing the reader does can reach back into the
//! log.
//!
//! These are guard tests. On a correctly pull-only core they pass as written;
//! a failure here means a liveness read mutated the store, which is the bug
//! this suite forecloses.
