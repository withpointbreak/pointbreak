# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI code assistants when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Pointbreak is an experimental Rust-native review record for understanding what a coding agent changed
and why. It should stay focused on a small, agent-review core with a data model that is
easy to reason about, test, and eventually expose to other tools.

Build the review stream as a pure, headless data layer before building the TUI. Rendering,
scrolling, navigation, and note placement should derive from one explicit review-stream model rather
than parallel sources of truth.

## Commit Conventions

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), enforced
by [cocogitto](https://docs.cocogitto.io/) via a `commit-msg` git hook.

Format: `<type>: <subject>`

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `revert`, `docs`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `refactor`, `chore`, `style`

Use unscoped commits. The `cog.toml` scopes list is empty, so `cog check` rejects any scoped
commit (for example `fix(review): ...`). Do not add a scope until that list is populated.

Rules:

- Header must be 100 characters or fewer
- Subject must start with a lowercase letter
- Subject must not end with a period
- Use imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature")

For non-trivial changes, include a body after a blank line explaining what changed and why. A
one-liner is fine for truly simple changes.

Use `cog check` to validate commit history and `cog changelog` to preview changelog output. Use
`git commit` for creating commits; the commit-msg hook handles validation.

## Branch Conventions

This project uses Conventional Branch names, enforced by a `pre-push` git hook.

Format: `<type>/<description>`

Types: `feat/`, `fix/`, `hotfix/`, `release/`, `chore/`

Rules:

- Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- Include issue numbers when applicable, such as `feat/issue-42-add-review-stream`
- Keep descriptions concise

## Common Commands

Use `just` for day-to-day work. Tests use `cargo-nextest` for parallel execution.

```bash
just test                      # Run all tests
just test-file integration     # Run a specific test file
just test -E 'test(test_name)' # Run a specific nextest filter
just lint                      # fmt check + clippy
just check                     # commit check + build + lint + test
just build                     # Debug build
just release                   # Release build
just run --help                # Run the CLI
just fmt                       # Format code
```

Run `just --list` for grouped recipe discovery. Read `docs/development.md` before choosing gates for
Inspector, extension, release, installer, canonical-example, or browser changes; `just check` is the
complete Rust gate, not a universal repository gate. `scripts/README.md` documents script ownership,
side effects, expected outcomes, and failure classes.

## Implementation Guidance

Keep the first version deliberately smaller than hunk. Git access runs through one typed backend
seam (ADR-0040): the routable `git_*` helpers dispatch through a closed backend enum resolved at a
single choke point. Subprocess `git` stays the permanent home of the identity-bearing capture diff
and write-tree (which are non-routable — direct-subprocess, not seam methods) and of honest
byte-faithful fixtures. The in-process `gix` backend ships in the default build (the `gix` feature,
on by default; `POINTBREAK_GIT_BACKEND=subprocess` is the runtime escape hatch) and owns the
presentation-only reads and the spec-deterministic identity scalars, each flipped to default only
after a differential parity harness proved byte-equal typed output (and message-equal errors) on
macOS and Windows; see `docs/adr/adr-0040-git-backend-seam-and-hybrid.md`.

The headless model should own file identity, file order, hunk identity, row geometry, note anchors,
navigation cursors, and serializable review/session state. The TUI should be a projection of that
model, not the authoritative owner of review semantics.

Pointbreak's internal architecture language treats revisions, task attempts, and similar subjects as
software work objects coordinated through an append-only event log and purpose-built projections.
A Change is the stable multi-round work session; a Revision is one exact captured content state
(observations, assessments, and validation evidence attach to that Revision, never float to the
Change). Content-changing review repairs capture a new Revision inside the same Change with explicit
replace, parallel, or consolidation intent. Context may be ported explicitly, but validation and
assessments never move. A commit that materializes the already-reviewed state does not create a new
Revision: use the proof-first `pointbreak association land` workflow. The low-level
`pointbreak association record` command records structural provenance only and cannot authorize
content-qualified landing language. Read
`docs/substrate-language.md`, `docs/substrate-thesis-summary.md`,
`docs/adr/adr-0003-agent-resource-claims-advisory-first.md`,
`docs/adr/adr-0017-eventtarget-identity-layering-and-engagement-naming.md`, and
`docs/adr/adr-0018-event-borne-supersession-replaces-lineage.md` before substrate-shaped refactors.
Substrate vocabulary is internal; user-facing commands and JSON documents should stay domain-named.

## Testing

Start with headless tests before TUI tests. Useful fixtures include multi-file diffs with sidecar
ordering, untracked files, renames, binary and mode-only changes, context-row note anchors,
annotated-hunk navigation, terminal resize geometry, and large synthetic changesets.
