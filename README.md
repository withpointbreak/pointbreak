Shoreline is terminal code review built for the human-agent loop — capture a change, record
observations and interventions, resolve them asynchronously, and resume the review state across
sessions.

Install the `shoreline` crate; it provides the `shore` command:

```bash
cargo install shoreline
shore --help
```

The v0.1.0 release is focused on a small, Rust-native review core with a data model that is easy to
reason about, test, and eventually expose to other tools.

For a narrative end-to-end walkthrough of the current review workflow — capturing a ReviewUnit,
inspecting it, recording observations, input requests, and assessments, and the distinction between
durable events, rebuildable projections, and command-output JSON — see
[docs/review-workflow.md](docs/review-workflow.md). The "Current CLI" section below remains the
per-command reference.

Maintainers running a confidence pass after big changes can use the manual testing playbook in
[docs/manual-testing.md](docs/manual-testing.md): copy/paste scratch-repo recipes for capture,
observations, input requests, assessments, history, unit show, sidecar import, stale-note reload,
and storage rebuildability.

Release planning and publishing are documented in [docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md).

## Name

The package is named `shoreline` because that is the boundary where tool-assisted changes meet
human review. The installed command stays `shore` because command names should remain short and
practical.

## Product Intent

Shoreline is for code review in a terminal. It should help a reviewer inspect:

- the actual working-tree diff
- the review notes a reviewer or tool attached to files and code rows
- the diff stream in the order the reviewer should read it
- which notes are attached to which code rows
- enough recoverable session state that review context is not lost when a UI is restarted

The first version should be a focused terminal review tool, not a generic summarizer.

## Core Architecture Principle

Build the review stream as a pure, headless data layer before building the TUI.

The hard part is not simply drawing a diff in a TUI. The hard part is keeping these behaviors
aligned:

- file order
- diff-section order
- row geometry
- scroll position
- selected diff section
- note anchors
- note navigation
- terminal resize behavior
- saved or live review-note context

Shoreline should avoid parallel sources of truth. Rendering, scrolling, and navigation should derive
from one explicit review-stream model.

That model should own:

- file identity, status, old path, and new path
- file order, including sidecar-provided narrative order
- diff-section identity and order
- diff-section header spans, including context rows
- rendered review rows
- row and section geometry
- note anchors and resolved note targets
- diff-section navigation cursors
- note navigation cursors
- serializable review/session state

The TUI should be a projection of that model. Widgets may render state, but they should not become
the authoritative owners of scroll, selection, or navigation semantics.

Durable workflow guidance is captured in [docs/storage-model.md](docs/storage-model.md),
[docs/input-request-model.md](docs/input-request-model.md), and
[docs/assessment-model.md](docs/assessment-model.md). Treat those as architecture guidance for
storage, event, input-request, and assessment design, not current V1 implementation scope.

## Initial Scope

Build:

- a Rust CLI binary
- working-tree `diff` support
- tracked and untracked file support
- unified-diff parsing into Shoreline's own file/diff-section/row model
- a native `review-notes.json` sidecar loader
- a split terminal diff view
- `[` and `]` navigation through the full diff stream
- `{` and `}` navigation through noted diff sections
- snapshot and acceptance fixtures for the review model

Prefer shelling out to `git` at first. A VCS abstraction can come later if the model earns it.

## Current CLI

The current executable surfaces are `shore show`, `shore dump`, `shore review capture`,
`shore review observation add/list`, `shore review input-request open/list/fetch/respond`,
`shore review assessment add/show`, `shore review history`, `shore review unit list/show`, and
`shore notes apply`.

All commands accept optional tracing flags:

```bash
--log <filter>
--log-format <compact|pretty|json>
--log-file <path>
```

Tracing writes to stderr by default. If stdout is being piped into JSON tools, prefer
`--log-file <path>` instead of `2>&1`; mixing stderr into stdout will corrupt the JSON stream.
`shore show` requires `--log-file` when tracing is enabled so trace lines do not scribble over the
raw-mode TUI. When `--log-file <path>` points inside the repository, Shoreline treats that path as a
command helper for the current command and excludes it from the reviewed snapshot and fingerprint.

`shore show` opens the first read-only terminal review view over the same headless review stream
used by the JSON dump command:

```bash
shore show [--repo <path>] [--review-notes <path>]
```

Behavior:

- `--repo <path>` defaults to `.` and may point at the repository root or a subdirectory inside it.
- `--review-notes <path>` loads Shoreline-native `review-notes.json`.
- When no explicit sidecar is supplied, repo-only `shore show` auto-loads durable imported notes
  from `.shore/` if the store exists.
- Press `r` to re-ingest the working tree and reload the projection without losing your cursor
  position. Reload preserves the cursor by row ID when possible, then falls back to the nearest
  file and diff section, the file, or the first row in the refreshed stream.
- Stale and orphan review notes appear as dedicated rows you can park the cursor on. The detail
  pane labels the row with its resolution status and the original target path and line range.
- Explicit sidecar inputs are command helpers and are not themselves included in the reviewed
  snapshot for that command. Other unrelated tracked and untracked files remain visible.
- The view is read-only: it renders the working-tree diff, resolved review notes, and recoverable
  diagnostics, but it does not mutate notes or write session state.
- Keybindings are intentionally small: `q`/Esc/Ctrl+C quits, `j`/`k` or Up/Down moves by row, `[` and
  `]` move through diff sections, and `{` and `}` move through noted sections.

`shore dump` remains the JSON contract over the headless model so other frontends and tests can
consume the same review stream:

```bash
shore dump [--repo <path>] [--review-notes <path>] [--pretty | --compact]
```

Behavior:

- `--repo <path>` defaults to `.` and may point at the repository root or a subdirectory inside it.
- `--review-notes <path>` loads Shoreline-native `review-notes.json`.
- When no explicit sidecar is supplied, repo-only `shore dump` auto-loads durable imported notes
  from `.shore/` if the store exists.
- When durable notes no longer match the current snapshot, `shore dump` emits an optional
  `reload_diagnostics` section containing the staleness entries, each with a `code` and `message`.
  The `reload_diagnostics` section is omitted entirely when there is no reload-time staleness.
- The review stream emits a `stale_note` row variant when a durable note's anchor no longer matches
  the current diff (the file is present but the line range is unsatisfiable). When a note's file is
  absent from the snapshot entirely, the stream emits a synthetic `<orphaned notes>` file header
  followed by one `stale_note` row per orphan note. Stale-note rows carry `note_id`, `title`,
  `resolution_status` (`stale` or `orphaned`), `target_path`, and `target_line_range`. The
  synthetic header is omitted when there are no orphan notes.
- The `kind` field on each `stream.rows[*]` entry is the externally tagged JSON representation of
  the row-kind enum: a single-key object whose key is the snake_case variant tag and whose value
  carries that variant's fields. This is the raw model serialization, not a separately-projected
  dump shape; any future projection would be a versioned `schema`/`version` bump on the dump
  document. Example `file_header` and `stale_note` row entries:

  ```json
  {
    "id": "row:0000",
    "ordinal": 0,
    "file_id": "src/lib.rs",
    "hunk_id": null,
    "kind": {
      "file_header": {
        "path": "src/lib.rs",
        "status": "modified"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  ```json
  {
    "id": "row:0003",
    "ordinal": 3,
    "file_id": "src/lib.rs",
    "hunk_id": null,
    "kind": {
      "stale_note": {
        "note_id": "note:stale",
        "title": "Stale review note",
        "resolution_status": "stale",
        "target_path": "src/lib.rs",
        "target_line_range": { "start": 99, "end": 99 }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Other `kind` variants follow the same envelope: `hunk_header`, `diff`, `metadata`, `note`, and
  `empty_state`.
- Row IDs (`stream.rows[*].id` and the `target_row_id` carried by `note` row kinds) are opaque
  strings. They are stable and unique within a single built review stream and safe to use as keys
  or to follow note references, but their internal format is implementation detail: do not parse
  them, derive ordering from them lexically, or assume any particular width or prefix. Use the
  sibling `ordinal` field if you need a numeric position. Format changes are not breaking changes
  to the dump contract.
- Explicit sidecar inputs and `--log-file <path>` are command helpers and are not themselves
  included in the reviewed snapshot for that command. Other unrelated tracked and untracked files
  remain visible.
- Output is compact by default for scripts. Use `--pretty` for human-readable formatting;
  `--compact` is accepted as an explicit compact-format request.
- Recoverable review-note diagnostics stay in the JSON document and the command exits successfully.
- Fatal errors, such as unreadable files or malformed JSON, are written to stderr and exit
  non-zero; unreadable sidecar errors include the attempted path.

The dump output is Shoreline introspection JSON and uses snake_case fields. Native `review-notes.json`
input keeps its schema-defined camelCase fields such as `oldPath`, `startLine`, and `createdAt`.

`shore review capture` records the current V1 ReviewUnit:

```bash
shore review capture [--repo <path>]
```

Behavior:

- `--repo <path>` defaults to `.` and may point at the repository root or a subdirectory inside it;
  durable state is created at the Git worktree root.
- The ReviewUnit is the base endpoint, target endpoint, and captured diff snapshot. V1 captures the
  local Git worktree from `HEAD` to the working tree, including untracked files.
- The command creates and uses local `.shore/` storage and adds `.shore/` to the worktree
  `.gitignore` when needed.
- `.shore/events/` stores immutable local event files. `.shore/state.json` is a rebuildable
  projection, not the authority.
- `.shore/` is local, synchronous storage. V1 uses a single-writer contract: one active Shoreline writer
  at a time per `.shore/` directory. Event writes use per-file durable facts and rebuildable
  projections rather than a daemon or shared mutable JSON authority.
- Full captured snapshots are Shoreline-owned immutable artifacts under `.shore/artifacts/snapshots/`.
  The `review_unit_captured` event binds to the snapshot artifact's canonical content hash, so
  replay can detect changed artifact facts. The output exposes ReviewUnit, revision, and snapshot
  IDs plus that content hash, but does not expose artifact paths as user-facing API.
- `--log-file <path>` is command-helper plumbing and is excluded from the captured snapshot and
  content-derived ReviewUnit fingerprint for that command. Other unrelated tracked and untracked
  files remain part of the capture unless the caller keeps them out of the worktree.
- Sidecar inputs are not part of the capture contract. Native `review-notes.json` remains an
  optional import/transport adapter for read/import commands.
- Output is compact `shore.review-capture` JSON. Command output documents are the external contract
  for automation; `.shore/state.json` is only a rebuildable projection, and artifact paths remain
  Shoreline-owned storage details.

`shore review capture` does not add a daemon, delivery queue, approval flow, async or remote
storage backend, or note mutation. `.shore/events/` is the local authoritative event log, not a
mailbox or retry queue.

`shore review observation` records and reads append-only reviewer observations for a captured
ReviewUnit:

```bash
shore review capture
shore review observation add --track agent:codex --title "Check error handling" --file src/lib.rs
shore review observation list --track agent:codex
```

Behavior:

- `shore review observation add` requires `--track` and `--title`.
- Tracks are review lanes, not actor or tool provenance. Shoreline still records writer provenance from
  local Git config and the Shoreline tool identity in the event envelope.
- Without `--file`, the observation is review-wide and targets the whole ReviewUnit.
- With `--file <path>`, the observation targets a file in the captured snapshot.
- With `--file <path> --start-line <n> [--end-line <n>]`, the observation targets a range on the
  selected side (`--side <old|new>`, default `new`).
- Bodies may come from `--body`, `--body-file`, or `--body-stdin`. Large bodies are stored as
  Shoreline-owned `shore.note-body` artifacts while command output keeps artifact paths private.
- `--supersedes <observation-id>` records a correction by appending a new observation that names the
  older observation. Standalone retraction is deferred.
- `shore review observation list` replays durable events for the ReviewUnit. Bodies are omitted by
  default and hydrated only with `--include-body`; `--track`, `--file`, and repeated `--tag` filter
  the returned rows.
- If repeated writes create multiple events with the same `observationId`, `observation list`
  returns one logical row and includes a duplicate semantic diagnostic.
- Output is compact `shore.review-observation-add` or `shore.review-observation-list` JSON by
  default. `observation list` also accepts `--pretty`.
- Native observations appear in `shore review unit show`. They are not yet projected into
  `shore dump` or `shore show`.

`shore review input-request` records and reads durable pause/decision requests for a captured
ReviewUnit:

```bash
shore review input-request open --track human:kevin --title "Need approval" \
  --reason manual-decision-required [--mode operative|advisory]
shore review input-request list [--status open|responded|ambiguous|all]
shore review input-request fetch <input-request-id> [--include-body]
shore review input-request respond <input-request-id> --outcome approved [--reason "approved"]
```

Behavior:

- `input-request open` requires `--track`, `--title`, and `--reason`. `--mode` defaults to
  `operative`; `advisory` requests are durable and visible but do not imply a cooperative client
  must pause.
- Request targets mirror observations: review-wide by default, `--file <path>` for a captured file,
  `--file <path> --start-line <n> [--end-line <n>]` for a range, or `--observation
  <observation-id>` for an existing native observation in the same ReviewUnit.
- Request bodies may come from `--body`, `--body-file`, or `--body-stdin`. Large bodies reuse
  Shoreline-owned `shore.note-body` artifacts while command output keeps artifact paths private.
- `input-request list` is the V1 polling read surface. It replays `.shore/events/`, defaults to
  open requests, and can filter by `--track`, `--mode`, `--file`, and `--status`.
- `input-request fetch <id> --include-body` returns one input request and hydrates the body when
  requested.
- `input-request respond <id>` appends an `input_request_responded` event with an `--outcome` of
  `approved`, `rejected`, `dismissed`, `superseded`, or `abandoned`. The optional reason may come
  from `--reason`, `--reason-file`, or `--reason-stdin`.
- Repeated writes with the same `inputRequestId` or `inputRequestResponseId` are preserved but
  collapsed in read output with duplicate semantic diagnostics.
- Multiple different response events are preserved as append-only facts. Read surfaces report the
  request as `ambiguous` instead of picking a timestamp winner.
- Output documents are compact `shore.review-input-request-open`,
  `shore.review-input-request-list`, `shore.review-input-request-fetch`, and
  `shore.review-input-request-respond` JSON by default. Read commands also accept `--pretty`.
- V1 is durable and polling-friendly. It does not add a daemon, filesystem watch mode, TUI prompt,
  notification transport, or cancellation/escalation event.
- Native input requests appear in `shore review unit show`. They are not yet projected into
  `shore dump` or `shore show`.

`shore review assessment` records and reads review calls for a captured ReviewUnit:

```bash
shore review assessment add --track human:kevin --assessment accepted --summary "ship it"
shore review assessment show [--all] [--track human:kevin] [--include-summary]
```

Behavior:

- `assessment add` requires `--track` and `--assessment`. Tracks are review lanes; writer
  provenance still comes from the event envelope.
- V1 assessment values are `accepted`, `accepted-with-follow-up`, `needs-changes`, and
  `needs-clarification`.
- Targets mirror the ReviewUnit ledger: review-wide by default, `--file <path>` for a captured
  file, `--file <path> --start-line <n> [--end-line <n>]` for a range, `--observation
  <observation-id>`, `--input-request <input-request-id>`, or `--target-assessment
  <assessment-id>` for native facts in the same ReviewUnit.
- Summaries may come from `--summary`, `--summary-file`, or `--summary-stdin`. Large summaries reuse
  Shoreline-owned `shore.note-body` artifacts while command output keeps artifact paths private.
- `--replaces <assessment-id>` is the only V1 relationship that removes an older assessment from the
  current set.
- `--related-observation` and `--related-input-request` record evidence links. They do not mutate
  observations or close input requests; use `shore review input-request respond` for input-request
  lifecycle.
- `assessment show` replays `.shore/events/`, reports current status as `unassessed`, `resolved`,
  or `ambiguous`, and defaults to current assessments only. `--all` includes replaced records.
- Repeated writes with the same `assessmentId` are preserved but collapsed in read output with a
  duplicate semantic diagnostic.
- Output documents are compact `shore.review-assessment-add` and `shore.review-assessment-show`
  JSON by default. `assessment show` also accepts `--pretty`.
- Native assessments appear in `shore review unit show`. They are not yet projected into
  `shore dump` or `shore show`.
- State-change outcomes such as deferred, split-out, overridden, and superseded are ordinary review
  observations when they are needed. Record them with `shore review observation add` and a concrete
  tag such as `--tag state-change:deferred`.

`shore review history` reads the chronological ledger of durable Shoreline events:

```bash
shore review history [--repo <path>] [--review-unit <id>] [--track <track-id>] \
  [--event-type <event-type>]... [--include-body] [--pretty | --compact]
```

Behavior:

- History replays `.shore/events/` and emits compact `shore.review-history` v1 JSON by default.
- `eventSetHash` and `eventCount` describe the full validated event set used to build the output,
  even when filters return only a subset of entries.
- `historyCount` is the number of returned entries after filters.
- Entries are sorted by `occurredAt`, then `eventId`, as display chronology. Lifecycle projections
  still use explicit replacement/resolution relationships rather than timestamp winners.
- `--review-unit`, `--track`, and repeated `--event-type` narrow the returned entries. Event-type
  CLI values are kebab-case, such as `review-observation-recorded`.
- Body-like text is omitted by default. `--include-body` hydrates observation bodies, input request
  bodies, input request response reasons, assessment summaries, and imported-note bodies.
- History preserves raw append-only facts. Duplicate semantic events remain visible as separate
  entries while shared duplicate diagnostics are included in the document.
- Raw event files, event filenames, artifact paths, and `state.json` remain internal storage. The
  command-output JSON is the integration surface.
- History is not the full ReviewUnit row projection. Use `shore review unit show` for the composite
  narrative-first plus snapshot-complete view of one captured ReviewUnit.

`shore review unit show` reads the full projection for one captured ReviewUnit:

```bash
shore review unit show [--repo <path>] [--review-unit <id>] [--track <track-id>] \
  [--include-body] [--pretty | --compact]
```

Behavior:

- The command emits compact `shore.review-unit` v1 JSON by default.
- When exactly one ReviewUnit has been captured, Shoreline selects it automatically. If multiple
  captured ReviewUnits exist, pass `--review-unit <id>` to select one explicitly.
- The output includes ReviewUnit identity, event-set freshness metadata, filters, summary counts,
  current assessment status, native observations, input requests, assessments, imported adapter
  notes, projection rows, and diagnostics.
- Rows are narrative-first, then snapshot-complete. Native ledger facts and imported adapter notes
  appear before the captured snapshot remainder; the snapshot remainder still includes every
  captured file, metadata row, hunk header, and diff row.
- `--track <track-id>` filters narrative facts without changing the selected ReviewUnit, event-set
  freshness metadata, or captured snapshot completeness.
- Body-like text is omitted by default. `--include-body` hydrates observation bodies, input request
  bodies and response reasons, assessment summaries, and imported-note bodies.
- Raw event files, event filenames, artifact paths, snapshot artifact paths, and `state.json` remain
  internal storage. The command-output JSON is the integration surface.
- `shore review unit show` is distinct from `shore review history`: history is the chronological raw
  event listing, while unit show is the composite ReviewUnit view for agents and future frontends.

`shore notes apply` imports review notes into Shoreline-owned durable state without publishing a
revision:

```bash
shore notes apply --repo <path> --review-notes <path>
```

Behavior:

- `--repo <path>` defaults to `.` and may point at the repository root or a subdirectory inside it;
  durable state is created at the Git worktree root.
- `--review-notes <path>` is required.
- The command initializes local `.shore/` storage when needed, records one immutable durable event
  per imported note, and rebuilds `.shore/state.json`.
- Native `review-notes.json` is an import/transport input, not the authoritative persisted Shoreline
  store.
- Large note bodies may be stored as content-addressed note-body artifacts under
  `.shore/artifacts/notes/`; small note bodies remain inline in the imported-note event payload.
- Output is compact `shore.notes-apply` JSON with note counts, diagnostics, and the `statePath`.

## Explicit V1 Deferrals

Do not start by rebuilding a complete review platform.

Defer:

- daemon and multi-session brokering
- external IPC protocol
- live comment mutation
- stash/pager/difftool modes and any write-capable evolution of `shore show`
- full config layering
- menus and extensive chrome
- syntax highlighting
- word-level intra-line diff
- advanced mouse behavior

These are useful, but they should wrap a proven review model rather than shape it prematurely.

## Git And Diff Requirements

Shoreline keeps these Git diff cases explicit in the model, even when the UI renders them plainly:

- untracked files: `git diff` does not include them, so use `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`
  and synthesize diffs against `/dev/null`
- renames and copies: use `git diff -M` and model both `old_path` and `new_path`
- binary files
- submodules
- mode-only changes
- deleted files and new files
- diff sections with zero lines on one side
- context-row note anchors
- large changesets where rendering must not require every row to be visible at once

Line-level diff is acceptable for the first version. If word-level diff is deferred, make that an
honest product constraint.

## Review Notes Sidecar

Shoreline's native sidecar is `review-notes.json`. It is a transport/import file for ordered review
notes, not a persisted `.shore/` session-state format.

The sidecar should stay review-oriented and concise:

- one changeset summary
- file summaries in narrative order
- diff-section or line-level review notes with clear title and body text

Review notes belong beside the code. The first UI should render notes spatially near the targeted
diff section or row, and note navigation should move through section-specific notes in the review
stream.

The sidecar file order is intentional. Shoreline should preserve that order when it differs from the raw
Git diff order.

Example native sidecar shape:

```json
{
  "schema": "shore.review-notes",
  "version": 1,
  "summary": "Review notes for the current change",
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "src/model/mod.rs",
      "notes": [
        {
          "id": "note:decode-json",
          "title": "decode_json keeps the error boundary explicit",
          "body": "Full review note body in markdown.",
          "target": {
            "side": "new",
            "startLine": 9,
            "endLine": 9
          },
          "author": "reviewer",
          "source": "codex",
          "createdAt": "2026-05-09T00:04:07.818Z",
          "tags": ["parser"],
          "confidence": "high"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Shoreline's native sidecar is `review-notes.json`.

When Shoreline imports these sidecars through `shore notes apply`, it persists immutable imported-note
events under `.shore/events/`. For large note bodies, Shoreline may store the body text as a
content-addressed artifact under `.shore/artifacts/notes/` while keeping the event payload bounded.

## Future Session Model

Daemon/session coordination is not v1, but the review model should be ready for it.

Future external tools should be able to ask for operations like:

- get current review state
- navigate to next or previous diff section
- navigate to next or previous note
- select a file or diff section
- add a live comment
- clear live comments
- dump the current review context

The model should use stable IDs and serializable state so this can be added without rewriting the
core.

## Rust Stack

Shoreline currently uses:

- `ratatui` plus `crossterm` for the terminal UI
- `serde` and `serde_json` for sidecar and state JSON
- shelling out to `git` for repository data
- focused headless tests before TUI behavior tests

Be careful with stateful widget idioms. Shoreline should keep model state authoritative and make TUI
widgets render from it.

## Testing Strategy

Start with headless tests before TUI tests.

Useful fixtures:

- multi-file diffs with narrative sidecar ordering
- untracked file diffs
- rename diffs
- binary and mode-only changes
- notes on context rows inside a diff section
- current diff section has no notes, then `{` or `}` should resolve relative to the full stream
- current diff section past the last note, then `}` should clamp to the last noted section rather than
  wrap
- terminal resize causing geometry recomputation
- large synthetic changesets

TUI tests should come after the review-stream model can prove geometry, navigation, and note
placement without a terminal.

## Non-Goals

Shoreline should not initially try to be:

- a general Git porcelain
- a complete review platform
- a web review UI
- a summarizer detached from the code
- a terminal framework experiment

The narrow goal is a reliable terminal review surface for tool-assisted or review-heavy changesets.
