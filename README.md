Shoreline is a local terminal review tool for code changes that humans and coding agents work on
together. Capture a change, record observations and input requests, assess the review, and resume
from durable local state when the session continues later.

Install the `shoreline` crate; it provides the `shore` command:

```bash
cargo install shoreline
shore --help
```

## Quick Start

Start with the first-review walkthrough:

- [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md)

The short path is:

```bash
cd path/to/git-worktree
shore review capture
shore review unit show --pretty
```

Then record what you learn:

```bash
shore review observation add --track human:local --title "Check error handling"
shore review input-request open --track human:local --title "Need decision" \
  --reason manual-decision-required --mode advisory
shore review assessment add --track human:local --assessment needs-clarification \
  --summary "Small change, but one decision is still open."
```

Or browse the whole store visually — event timeline, per-ReviewUnit pages, and annotated diffs — in
a local web UI:

```bash
shore inspect --open
```

Shoreline stores local review facts in `.shore/data/`. Command output JSON is the integration surface;
raw event files, artifact paths, and `.shore/data/state.json` are internal storage details unless a
command explicitly documents them. Consumers that prefer to read and write those facts in process
can use the supported library API instead of the CLI — see [docs/library-api.md](docs/library-api.md).

## Current Commands

The current executable surfaces are:

- `shore show`
- `shore dump`
- `shore inspect`
- `shore review capture`
- `shore review observation add/list`
- `shore review input-request open/list/fetch/respond`
- `shore review assessment add/show`
- `shore review history`
- `shore review unit list/show`
- `shore notes apply`

See [docs/cli-reference.md](docs/cli-reference.md) for command options, output documents, schema
names, and V1 limitations.

## Agent Skills

Shoreline ships a portable author-handoff skill under [skills/](skills/README.md). Install it with:

```bash
npx skills add kevinswiber/shoreline
```

## Project Status

Shoreline v0.1.0 is an experimental Rust-native review core. The package is named `shoreline`
because a shoreline is the boundary where tool-assisted changes meet human review. The installed
command stays `shore` because command names should remain short and practical.

The current focus is a headless, durable review model first:

- Git working-tree or commit-range (`--base`) capture into a ReviewUnit
- append-only local events under `.shore/data/events/`
- immutable snapshot and note-body artifacts under `.shore/data/artifacts/`
- rebuildable projections and command-output JSON
- a read-only terminal view over the same model

## Design Principles

- Keep the review stream as a pure, headless data layer.
- Let rendering, scrolling, navigation, note placement, and session state derive from one explicit
  review model.
- Prefer direct Shoreline commands for durable review facts.
- Treat sidecars as import/transport adapters, not as the authoritative store.
- Keep public command output JSON stable enough for automation and tests.

## Non-Goals For V1

Shoreline should not start as:

- a general Git porcelain
- a complete review platform
- a web review UI
- a summarizer detached from code
- a daemon, notification system, or multi-session broker
- a terminal framework experiment

The narrow goal is a reliable local review surface for tool-assisted or review-heavy changesets.
