Pointbreak Review is a durable, local-first review record for code changes that humans and coding
agents build together. It is designed for the iteration that happens long before a pull request
opens, where you might guide one agent to author a change and another to review it.

Coding agents generate far more activity than anyone can follow. Rather than store or replay full
transcripts, Pointbreak keeps only the facts that move a review forward: what changed and why, the
open questions, and each assessment. It records them as an append-only log you can read in the
terminal, browse in a local web inspector, or consume as JSON.

Every fact carries the actor that asserted it, human or agent, and can be signed with an Ed25519 key.
Signing never blocks a write, but when a signature is present the record becomes tamper-evident, and
a reader can tell whether each fact is merely signed or bound to a trusted identity. See
[docs/signing-ux.md](docs/signing-ux.md).

## Install

On macOS or Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/withpointbreak/pointbreak/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/withpointbreak/pointbreak/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installers select the correct release archive, verify its SHA-256 checksum, and install the
`shore` command. The published `pointbreak` crate also provides the `shore` command and can be
installed with `cargo install pointbreak`.

See [Installation](docs/installation.md) for version pinning, custom install directories, supported
platforms, manual downloads, and checksum verification.

## Quick Start

Start with the first-review walkthrough:

- [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md)

The short path is:

```bash
cd path/to/git-worktree
shore capture
shore revision show --format json-pretty
```

Then record what you learn:

```bash
shore observation add --track human:local --title "Check error handling"
shore input-request open --track human:local --title "Need decision" \
  --reason manual-decision-required --mode advisory
shore assessment add --track human:local --assessment needs-clarification \
  --summary "Small change, but one decision is still open."
```

In a real collaboration each actor records on its own track — the coding agent that authored the
change (`agent:codex`), a reviewer that is a human or another agent, and you (`human:local`) — so
every fact stays attributed to whoever asserted it. See
[the review workflow](docs/review-workflow.md) and
[agent authoring handoffs](docs/agent-authoring.md) for how the author and reviewer hand off.

Or browse the whole store visually — event timeline, per-revision pages, and annotated diffs — in
a local web UI:

```bash
shore inspect --open
```

Pointbreak stores local review facts in `.shore/data/`. Command output JSON is the integration surface;
raw event files, artifact paths, and `.shore/data/state.json` are internal storage details unless a
command explicitly documents them. Consumers that prefer to read and write those facts in process
can use the supported library API instead of the CLI — see [docs/library-api.md](docs/library-api.md).

## Commands

The `shore` command surface is still taking shape and will change before v1. See
[docs/cli-reference.md](docs/cli-reference.md) for the current commands, their options, output
documents, schema names, and V1 limitations.

## Agent Skills

Pointbreak ships a portable author-handoff skill under [skills/](skills/README.md). Install it with:

```bash
npx skills add withpointbreak/pointbreak
```

## Project Status

Pointbreak Review is experimental and under active development. The published crate is `pointbreak`;
the installed command stays `shore` because command names should remain short and practical.

The current focus is a headless, durable review model first:

- Git working-tree or commit-range (`--base`) capture into a revision
- append-only local events under `.shore/data/events/`
- immutable snapshot and note-body artifacts under `.shore/data/artifacts/`
- rebuildable projections and command-output JSON
- read-only terminal and local web views over the same model

just check
