//! Read-only projection of an event's co-signature set.
//!
//! `cosignatures(event)` is the event's inline attestation (member #1, if present)
//! unioned with every detached `event_signature` carrier targeting it, each member
//! tagged with its reader-relative verification status. The set is a grow-only set
//! (G-Set): member identity is the full attestation triple, so the union is
//! commutative, associative, and idempotent and the result is order-independent.
//!
//! Three invariants are load-bearing and structural here, so a future reader cannot
//! reintroduce the hazards they close:
//! - The dedup key is the **full attestation triple** — carried by the detached
//!   carrier's own `eventId` — never `(target, signer)`. Two distinct signatures by
//!   one signer are two members; an identical re-submission collapses to one.
//! - Only the **inline** member may be `Invalid`. A structurally invalid detached
//!   attestation is rejected before storage, so it is never in the log to project.
//! - There is **no** separate reconciliation: every member is an ordinary event
//!   already covered by the shipped, signature-blind event-set hash. A store missing
//!   a member just yields a smaller set and backfills the event on the next sync.
