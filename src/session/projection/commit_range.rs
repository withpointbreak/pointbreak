//! Git-free projection of a Revision's commit-range lifecycle.
//!
//! Folds `WorkObjectProposed` plus the four association/withdrawal events into a
//! per-unit view of which commits and refs the unit currently claims. Every
//! status is derived: `current = capture_target_seed ∪ (associated − withdrawn)`.
//! A commit-range capture seeds one anchored commit that is never withdrawable;
//! only association-backed edges are subtracted by their association id.
//!
//! This fold touches only `event_type` and `payload` — no git, no clock, no
//! store reads. Reachability (merged/live/orphaned) is a separate read-time
//! enrichment and never enters this view.
