//! Content-targeted artifact removal: the write workflow.
//!
//! `remove_content` takes an ergonomic selector, resolves it to a set of
//! content-addressed `content_hash`es from the event log + git reachability, and
//! emits **one `ArtifactRemoved` event per `content_hash`**. Removal is
//! content-targeted and remove-only: it never rewrites or tombstones an existing
//! event; the payload carries only the `content_hash`; the idempotency key is
//! non-overridable (`artifact_removed:<content_hash>`), so re-removing a hash
//! converges to the first-stored fact. One blob is shared by many review units
//! across sessions, so the workflow reports the units still referencing each
//! removed hash before acting, but there is no per-unit detach — removal targets
//! content.
//!
//! Physically reclaiming the bytes is the separate local `compact`/`gc` sweep;
//! there is no un-remove (re-capturing the same content re-materializes the blob
//! while the removal fact persists in the log).
