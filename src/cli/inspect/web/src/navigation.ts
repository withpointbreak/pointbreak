// The ref-chip resolution layer: turn a clicked reference chip into a router
// navigation (or a diff open), and reveal an event by fetching the page that
// contains it. Ported from the served app.js `resolveRef` / `revealEvent` /
// `revealBy` / `navigateToUnit` (→ `navigateToRevision`) / `navigateToTrack`, in
// the revision vocabulary.
//
// The history is server-paged now, so an event may be off the loaded window:
// revealing it fetches the page that contains it (`at=<id>`), and a structured id
// (observation / assessment / input-request) is resolved to its event by a server
// search before the reveal. The reveal helpers are async; `resolveRef` stays the
// sync entry point (it fire-and-forgets the async work), with `resolveRefAsync`
// for awaiting callers/tests. Everything routes through `router.navigate` (commit →
// the store subscriber repaints); navigation never calls render. It owns the single
// `document` `click→resolveRef` delegate (`onDocumentClick`, registered once by the
// composition root): chips render across timeline / detail / diff / cards, so it
// must stay one global listener. Per the detail layer's deferral, that same
// delegate also resolves the `data-reveal-revision` "show in timeline" button.
