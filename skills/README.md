# Pointbreak Agent Skills

This directory is the distribution source for Pointbreak's spec-conformant Agent Skills, installable
on any agentskills.io-conformant agent. It is not an auto-active project-skill path; install the
skills into the agent environment where you want them to run.

The recommended install path is:

```bash
npx skills add withpointbreak/pointbreak
```

Install the skill ahead of the work session where it should run, not after the implementation is
already finished.

## Included skills

- `pointbreak-author` records a durable author handoff at the end of a coherent implementation
  change, including advisory validation evidence for checks the author actually ran.
- `pointbreak-reviewer` reviews another agent's handoff, reads author validation evidence as context,
  records reviewer findings and reviewer-run checks, responds to operative requests, opens advisory
  requests for author decisions, and records one assessment.
- `pointbreak-author-response` lets the original author pick up a reviewer pass, respond to advisory
  requests, read reviewer validation evidence, make actionable fixes when needed, and record author
  response observations without assessing or recapturing.

Manual fallback for agents that read the shared Agent Skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/withpointbreak/pointbreak.git
cd pointbreak
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
cp -r skills/* ~/.agents/skills/
```

Claude Code currently does not read `~/.agents/skills/`, so copy the same canonical skills there
when using Claude Code:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -r skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

An optional `claude-extras/` overlay with Claude-only conveniences such as tool pre-approval could be
added later. The canonical skills in this directory stay plain Markdown with only `name` and
`description` frontmatter.

CI validates the canonical skills with the upstream Python `skills-ref` validator. Run the same
check locally with:

```bash
just skills-validate
```

Link the canonical skills into another project's agent-specific skill directories with:

```bash
just skills-link --project /path/to/project claude agents opencode
```

To intentionally link into user-level skill directories instead, pass `--user`:

```bash
just skills-link --user claude
```

Remove those symlinks by passing the same target and agents:

```bash
just skills-unlink --project /path/to/project claude agents opencode
```

Use the `agents` target for the shared `.agents/skills` convention. Codex scans that directory, so
`codex` is accepted as an alias for `agents`; `codex-legacy` links into `.codex/skills` when you
need the older Codex-specific location.
