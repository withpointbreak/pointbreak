# CLI Reference

This reference covers the public `pointbreak` command surface provided by the `pointbreak` crate.

Raw `shore.*` strings shown in schema examples are frozen persisted protocol identifiers, not a
current command, environment family, or storage namespace.

Command output JSON is the machine-integration surface, under a **tiered stability promise**. A
narrow **hard core** is frozen within each document's `version`:

- the envelope discriminators (`schema`, `version`) on every document;
- the field-paths a non-human consumer actually reads — `pointbreak capture`'s `revision.id`,
  `pointbreak input-request list`'s `inputRequests[].{id,title,mode,reasonCode,trackId}`, and
  `pointbreak input-request respond`'s `inputRequestResponseId` and `eventId`;
- the wire-value vocabularies — the assessment values, the input-request response outcomes, and the
  input-request `mode` (`operative`/`advisory`) and `reasonCode` value sets that ride the consumed
  `input-request list` field-paths (see the [`assessment`](#pointbreak-assessment) and
  [`input-request`](#pointbreak-input-request) sections). These vocabularies grow **additively** within a
  `version`: a new value may be appended (a soft-shell consumer selects the values it knows and
  tolerates the rest), but removing or renaming an existing value is a coordinated break (ADR-0029,
  Decision 7 amendment 2026-07-09).

Removing or renaming a hard-core field-path or value is a coordinated break: bump that document's
`version` and migrate consumers. Everything else in the documents is **soft shell** — stable but additive-evolvable within
a `version`: fields may be added, consumers must select by field name and tolerate unknown fields,
and removing, renaming, or reshaping an existing field bumps the `version`. Raw event files,
artifact paths, event filenames, and the store's `state.json` are internal storage details unless a
command explicitly returns them.

Document-emitting commands accept `--format <fmt>`, where `<fmt>` is `json`, `json-pretty`, or
`text`. Compact `json` is the default and the machine contract; `json-pretty` is the same document
indented for manual inspection; `text` is a disposable human rendering that scripts should not parse.

## Global Tracing Flags

Most commands accept optional tracing flags:

```bash
--log <filter>
--log-format <compact|pretty|json>
--log-file <path>
```

Tracing writes to stderr by default. When stdout is piped into JSON tools, prefer
`--log-file <path>` so trace lines do not corrupt the JSON stream.

When `--log-file <path>` points inside the repository, Pointbreak treats that path as command-helper
plumbing for the current command and excludes it from the reviewed snapshot and fingerprint.

## `pointbreak version`

```bash
pointbreak version [--format <fmt>]
```

`pointbreak version` emits the `pointbreak.version` version 1 compatibility document. Its hard core is
`cliVersion`, the version of the running CLI, and `documents`, a schema-to-version map covering every
CLI document in the handshake surface. Inspector API payloads are versioned separately. Clients use this
handshake before decoding other command output.

The `documents` map is sorted by schema. New entries are additive soft-shell growth, so consumers
must select the schemas they require and tolerate additional entries. `--format text` prints a short
human digest; compact JSON remains the default machine contract. The separate `pointbreak --version` flag
continues to print the human-facing CLI version.

## Actor Identity and Delegation

Every write records a writer `actorId`. By default it derives from the local Git identity
(`actor:git-email:<email>`, then `actor:git-name:<name>`, then `actor:local`). Set
`POINTBREAK_ACTOR_ID` to write under an explicit identity — agents use `actor:agent:<agent-name>`:

```bash
export POINTBREAK_ACTOR_ID="actor:agent:claude-code"
```

`POINTBREAK_ACTOR_ID` outranks the Git identity on every CLI write path, including paths without a
per-call override; a malformed value is ignored and falls through rather than corrupting
provenance.

Review read commands (`history`, the `observation` / `input-request` / `assessment` / `validation`
list and show commands, `revision show`, and the inspector) discover a checked-in delegation map at
`<repo>/.pointbreak/delegates.json` and resolve the human principal an agent wrote on behalf of,
rendering it beside the writer as `claude-code (for kevin@swiber.dev)`. Discovery is presence-based
— absent file, no change. A malformed `.pointbreak/delegates.json` prints a single warning to stderr and
the read proceeds with no resolution (advisory, never blocking). The file format is documented in
[storage-model.md](./storage-model.md).

The command group also previews the resolved writer and owns the **write** side of this config —
creating a delegation record or describing an actor's kind/roles. See `pointbreak identity whoami`,
`delegate`, and `attest` below.

### Signing

Every write may carry an Ed25519 signature. Which key signs (if any) follows this precedence:

1. `--sign-key <name|path>` on the write subcommand (a keystore key name or a path to a key file)
2. `POINTBREAK_SIGNING_KEY` (same shape: a key name or a path)
3. agent-context auto-keygen — under an `actor:agent:*` id, a passphrase-less per-machine key is
   generated on first write (see [agent-authoring.md](./agent-authoring.md))
4. the user-default keystore key named `default`
5. none — the write proceeds unsigned

`POINTBREAK_SIGNING=off` (case-insensitive) disables signing entirely; `POINTBREAK_SIGNING=auto` (the default)
resolves a signer where possible. `POINTBREAK_HOME` overrides the user-level key home (mainly for
tests/CI). **Signing never gates a write** (with one exception, below): any resolution failure (no key,
an unreadable key home, an unsupported algorithm, a malformed configured key, `POINTBREAK_SIGNING=off`)
degrades to an unsigned write at exit 0 with a one-line advisory diagnostic on stderr — it never blocks.
The sole exception is `pointbreak endorse` (below), where unsigned is a hard error because the
signature *is* the endorsement's content. See
[signing-ux.md](./signing-ux.md) for the human / agent / CI flows and the
`unsigned → untrusted_key → valid` ladder.

## Review Lanes

Every recorded fact — an observation, an assessment, a validation check, an input request, a
commit or ref association — is scoped to a **review lane**: a caller-chosen free-text label
naming who or what is doing the reviewing, such as `agent:codex` or a human reviewer's own
identity. There is no fixed vocabulary or required shape; the label is opaque to Pointbreak and
exists so a revision's facts can be filtered and grouped by who recorded them.

- On every write command that records a fact (`pointbreak observation add`,
  `pointbreak assessment add`, `pointbreak validation add`,
  `pointbreak association record` / `withdraw`, `pointbreak input-request open`),
  `--track <track-id>` is **required** and
  stamps the lane that owns the new fact.
- On read/list commands (`pointbreak observation list`, `pointbreak input-request list`,
  `pointbreak validation list`, `pointbreak assessment show`, `pointbreak history`,
  `pointbreak revision show`), `--track <track-id>` is **optional** and narrows the results to one
  lane; omitted, all lanes are returned.

## `pointbreak diff`

```bash
pointbreak diff [--repo <path>] [--revision <id>] [--stat] [--color <auto|always|never>] [--theme <theme>]
```

`pointbreak diff` prints a captured revision's diff — base to target, from the **frozen captured
snapshot** — as a text unified diff on stdout. It is the terminal reader for the immutable diff a
revision recorded; its subject is always the captured snapshot, never the live working tree
(`git diff` owns the live tree).

- `--repo <path>` defaults to `.` and may point at the repository root or a subdirectory inside it.
- `--revision <id>` selects the captured revision (a head seed): a current head resolves exactly, a
  superseded revision resolves its thread's current head. Omit it to diff the current capture; it is
  required when the store holds more than one candidate.
- `--stat` prints only the diffstat (a per-file summary and totals), not the diff body.
- `--color <auto|always|never>` controls ANSI syntax coloring of the diff body. `auto` (the default)
  colorizes only when stdout is a TTY, honoring `NO_COLOR` and `CLICOLOR_FORCE` (precedence: `--color`
  > `NO_COLOR` > `CLICOLOR_FORCE` > isatty); piped or redirected output stays plain. Color is pure
  presentation — stripping the ANSI reproduces the plain diff exactly.
- `--theme <theme>` picks the truecolor palette: `auto` (the default) detects the terminal
  background — light or dark — and selects the matching built-in palette; `light` / `dark` force a
  built-in; any other value names a bundled syntax theme, matched case-insensitively (bat's
  vocabulary, e.g. `"Monokai Extended"`, `"onehalflight"`, `"nord"`). Environment fallbacks: `POINTBREAK_THEME`, then
  bat's `BAT_THEME` (precedence: `--theme` > `POINTBREAK_THEME` > `BAT_THEME` > detection > dark). An
  unknown name from `--theme`/`POINTBREAK_THEME` is an error listing the valid vocabulary; an unknown
  inherited `BAT_THEME` warns on stderr and falls back. The terminal is queried only when colors
  are on, stdout is a direct truecolor TTY, and the preference is `auto` — piped output never
  probes and stays deterministic. Themes apply on truecolor terminals (`COLORTERM=truecolor`); the
  16-color palette always follows the terminal's own theme. Intraline (changed sub-word) emphasis
  renders as an add/del background tint on truecolor and as an underline on 16-color terminals.
- `pointbreak diff` is a **filter, not a pager**: it writes plain git-diff to any pipe or redirect and
  colorizes only when writing directly to a terminal, so it composes with the tools you already use —
  `pointbreak diff | less -R` to page, `pointbreak diff | delta` (or another diff renderer) to reformat,
  `pointbreak diff > change.diff` to save. There is no built-in pager and no `--no-pager` flag; use
  `--color always` to force color through a pipe (e.g. `pointbreak diff --color always | less -R`). A
  reader that closes the pipe early (`pointbreak diff | head`) is a clean exit.
- The command is **text-only and non-interactive**: it has no `--format` selector and emits no JSON
  (machine consumers read the review documents, e.g. `pointbreak revision show --format json`). Its output
  is **disposable** — wording, layout, and ordering may change between releases, so nothing should
  parse it.
- File headers carry the captured mode for `/dev/null`-sided changes: an added file with a recorded
  mode gets a `new file mode <mode>` line and a deleted file a `deleted file mode <mode>` line, next
  to the existing `old mode`/`new mode` pair for mode changes. This lets a saved `change.diff` read
  as a genuine add/delete instead of a `/dev/null` repository path, so ordinary textual changes
  replay with `git apply`. It is a fidelity improvement, **not** a guaranteed patch-export format:
  binary payloads, missing-final-newline markers, unusual path quoting, submodules, and object-ID
  index lines are out of scope, so treat `pointbreak diff` as human-oriented captured-diff readback.
- When a revision's captured content has been removed from the store, `pointbreak diff` prints a short
  "content is unavailable" line (with the removed content's short id) instead of a diff body.

## `pointbreak inspect`

```bash
pointbreak inspect [--repo <path>] [--host <loopback-ip>] [--port <n>] [--open] \
  [--api-only] [--format <text|json>]
```

`pointbreak inspect` starts a small local web server that visualizes the worktree's resolved store for
tracing event timelines and outcomes — the kind of inspection that is awkward against the raw JSON
files or per-command output.

- `--repo <path>` defaults to `.` and may point at the repository root or a subdirectory inside it.
- `--host <loopback-ip>` defaults to `127.0.0.1`. Non-loopback binds are rejected before the
  server attempts to listen. `--port <n>` defaults to `7878`; use `--port 0` to bind an ephemeral
  port, which is then printed.
- `--api-only` omits the static browser shell and assets. `--open` launches the browser shell and is
  rejected only with `--api-only`.
- `--format text|json` controls startup output independently of the served surface. Text output is
  the default: the browser surface prints a fragment capability URL, while `--api-only` prints
  labeled endpoint and token fields. JSON output is exactly one compact
  `pointbreak.inspect-startup` v1 line with the actual loopback host/port and process-local bearer.
- Every process generates a distinct bearer. All requests require the exact advertised `Host`, and
  every `/api/*` request also requires exactly one `Authorization: Bearer <token>` before routing,
  store, projection, or cache work. Authentication failures return an empty `401`. The fixed static
  shell and assets need no bearer and never touch the store; they are the recovery surface when a
  browser lacks or loses its credential.
- The browser moves the fragment token into origin-scoped `sessionStorage` and scrubs it before
  routing. Its connection chrome distinguishes authentication failure, an unreachable server, and
  an authenticated protocol/data error, with route-preserving Reconnect and Retry actions. The
  bearer must not be logged, placed in a request target or referrer, or persisted outside the
  documented startup/session credential carriers.
- The server runs until interrupted with Ctrl-C.

The page provides a chronological event timeline (filterable by track, revision, thread, and
event type, newest-first by default), a per-event detail view, a composite per-revision page showing
the current-assessment status plus grouped observations, input requests, assessments, and
competing-head badges, a supersession-thread list/detail view showing heads, threaded revisions,
diagnostics, and stale superseded-revision facts, and the captured diff for a revision annotated with
the review facts anchored to each line. Validation checks recorded with `pointbreak validation add`
appear throughout — as a labeled timeline event type, a "Validation checks" section on the revision
page (with the check name, status, trigger, and exit code), and on thread cards — shown for context
only; they do not affect the current assessment and carry no merge or acceptance authority. The
reader-relative `verificationStatus` and `endorsements` readback (see
[Verification status and endorsement readback](#verification-status-and-endorsement-readback))
renders beside events and review facts: the per-event signature status as a chip on the timeline,
detail view, and revision fact cards, and the endorsement classification with its resolved
`endorser` and `endorserAttributes` on the detail view and revision page — presented as advisory,
render-only information, never as a gate or verdict. Long IDs render as
truncated, clickable references that navigate to the resource they name, and the page auto-refreshes
when the store changes or a freshness diagnostic appears or clears.

The inspector is a read-only, single-store, localhost developer tool. It reads through the same
validated projections as `pointbreak history` and `pointbreak revision show` rather than parsing raw
storage, and it serves over a synchronous, dependency-free HTTP server with no async runtime. The
Most of the small JSON API remains an internal surface for the bundled page. Three v1 bundled-pair
documents are compatibility-advertised by `pointbreak version`: `/api/snapshots/{id}` returns
`pointbreak.review-snapshot`, `/api/freshness` returns `pointbreak.inspect-freshness`, and JSON
startup emits `pointbreak.inspect-startup`. `/api/version` mirrors the exact `pointbreak.version`
v1 document emitted by `pointbreak version`. The remaining endpoints and inspector-private payloads are
not promoted contracts.

Every worktree of a clone resolves the shared common-dir store (`<git-common-dir>/pointbreak`), so the inspector
renders snapshots captured in sibling worktrees as well as the current one. The `/api/snapshots/{id}`
payload is **content-only**: it carries the immutable diff content and its `contentHash` only — no
`revisionId`, `source`, `base`, or `target`. The captured worktree path is therefore simply absent
from the snapshot wire (there is nothing to redact). Endpoint/target display lives on
`/api/revisions/{id}` and `/api/revisions`, derived from the revision projection (a path-private
`targetDisplay` block), not from the snapshot artifact. `pointbreak revision list` JSON still carries
`target.worktreeRoot`, unchanged.

## `pointbreak capture`

```bash
pointbreak capture [--repo <path>] [--base <rev> | --root | --staged | --unstaged] \
  [--target <rev>] [--include-untracked] [--allow-empty] \
  [--path <pathspec>]... [--supersedes <revision-id>]...
```

`pointbreak capture` records the current V1 revision: the base endpoint, target endpoint, and
captured diff snapshot. By default V1 captures the local Git worktree from `HEAD` (or Git's empty
tree before the first commit) to the working tree (source `git_worktree`). That default is a
combined "what differs from the baseline" capture: it includes staged and unstaged tracked changes
because both differ from `HEAD`. Like `git diff HEAD`, default capture excludes untracked files; add
`--include-untracked` to synthesize untracked files as added files in the captured snapshot.
In a newly initialized repository with no commits, default worktree capture uses Git's empty tree as
the base endpoint and the working tree as the target. If the only files are still untracked, use
`pointbreak capture --include-untracked`.

By default, a selected source that produces zero changed files is an error. The error suggests
likely source flags such as `--include-untracked`, `--staged`, or `--unstaged` when they might
explain the empty result. Use `--allow-empty` to intentionally record an empty revision.

- With `--base <rev>`, capture instead records the committed range from `<rev>` to `--target`
  (default `HEAD`) as a `git_commit_range` source. Both revs are resolved with `git rev-parse` to
  commit OIDs at capture time: annotated tags peel to their commit, and a rev that does not exist or
  does not name a commit (a blob or tree) is rejected with an error that names the rev. The snapshot
  is the `base..target` tree diff with no working-tree, index, or untracked involvement, so both
  endpoints serialize as `git_commit` and no worktree path appears in the output. `--target`
  defaults to `HEAD` under `--base`. Re-capturing the same range is idempotent and reports
  `eventsExisting`, and an equivalent rev spelling (`HEAD~1` versus the resolved OID) captures the
  same revision because rev spellings are never stored. Like worktree capture, a range capture lands
  in the shared common-dir store, so it is immediately visible from sibling worktrees (see below).
- With `--root`, capture records Git's empty tree to `--target` (default `HEAD`) as a
  `git_root_commit` source. The base endpoint serializes as `git_tree`; the target endpoint
  serializes as `git_commit`. This is the supported way to review a repository's first commit, or
  any explicit target commit as "all files added", without creating orphan-branch workarounds.
  `--root` cannot be combined with `--base`, `--staged`, or `--unstaged`, and `--target` is
  accepted only with `--base` or `--root`. Like `--base`, root capture reads only committed trees:
  the working tree, index, untracked files, and command-helper paths do not affect the captured
  revision.
- With `--staged`, capture records staged changes only as a `git_staged` source. If `HEAD` exists,
  the base endpoint is the current commit and the target endpoint is the captured Git index tree. If
  the repository has no commits yet, the base endpoint is Git's empty tree and the target is still
  the captured index tree. The working tree and untracked files are not read, so unstaged edits do
  not affect the captured revision.
- With `--unstaged`, capture records the captured index tree to the working tree as a
  `git_unstaged` source. This mirrors `git diff` from the index by default: staged changes are in
  the base endpoint and untracked files are excluded. Add `--include-untracked` to synthesize
  untracked files as added files without staging or mutating them. In a repository with no commits,
  `--unstaged --include-untracked` captures untracked working-tree files from the empty index tree
  to the working tree.
- `--include-untracked` is valid only with default worktree capture or `--unstaged`. It is rejected
  with `--base`, `--root`, and `--staged` because those modes are tree/index captures rather than
  worktree-plus-untracked captures. To capture a new repository's untracked initial files, use
  `pointbreak capture --include-untracked`, not `pointbreak capture --root --include-untracked`.
- `--allow-empty` is valid with every capture source. Without it, Pointbreak refuses to record a
  revision whose selected source has no changed files. This keeps accidental empty captures from
  hiding a missed `--include-untracked`, `--staged`, `--unstaged`, or pathspec typo while still
  allowing an explicit empty revision when that is the intended review object.
- Durable state lands in the shared common-dir store at `<git-common-dir>/pointbreak` under the clone's Git common
  directory (the default for every worktree). An `ephemeral` worktree instead keeps its own
  discardable `.pointbreak/data/` store. A legacy flat `.pointbreak/` store from before the `.pointbreak/data/`
  layout is a retired pre-1.0 format: it is detected and refused, not migrated — distinct from
  `pointbreak store migrate`, which folds a pre-flip worktree-local `.pointbreak/data/` store into the shared
  store; see [storage-model.md](./storage-model.md#migrations-and-doctor).
- Opting into ephemeral mode generates a committed `.pointbreak/.gitignore` (two lines: `data/` +
  `*.local.json`) when the paths are not already ignored, so the worktree-local store stays out of
  `git status`; the file is visible, meant to be committed, and survives clone. Writer-initializing
  commands against the ephemeral store generate it too; a shared-store write generates nothing (the
  shared store lives inside `.git/`, which git already ignores) and never mutates the working tree.
  Nothing writes `.git/info/exclude` anymore, and no tracked `.gitignore` is ever modified.
  Committed config siblings (`.pointbreak/delegates.json`, `.pointbreak/actor-attributes.json`,
  `.pointbreak/allowed-signers.json`, `.pointbreak/store.json`) stay tracked; only `.pointbreak/data/` and the
  private `.pointbreak/delegates.local.json`, `.pointbreak/actor-attributes.local.json`, and
  `.pointbreak/store.local.json` overrides are excluded.
- The store subtree (`events/`, `state.json`, and `artifacts/`) is the same wherever it resolves:
  the shared common-dir store at `<git-common-dir>/pointbreak` by default, or an `ephemeral` worktree's own
  `.pointbreak/data/`.
- `events/` stores immutable event files.
- `state.json` is a rebuildable projection, not the authority.
- Full captured snapshots are Pointbreak-owned immutable object artifacts under `artifacts/objects/`.
- The `work_object_proposed` event binds to the object artifact's canonical content hash; the
  content-only artifact body carries no revision identity or endpoints (those live on the event).
- Output is compact `pointbreak.review-capture` JSON and includes the revision and object IDs
  plus `objectArtifactContentHash`.
- With `--supersedes <revision-id>` (repeatable, order-independent), the capture records that it
  evolves past the named revisions, extending the supersession DAG. The new revision becomes a thread
  head; when two captures supersede the same predecessor, the competing heads are surfaced rather than
  auto-collapsed.
- With `--path <pathspec>` (repeatable), the capture is scoped to the given git pathspec(s): both
  the tracked diff and any enabled untracked-file synthesis include only matching files. This
  composes with the default worktree capture, with `--base`/`--target`, with `--root`/`--target`,
  and with `--staged` or `--unstaged`. The syntax is
  native git pathspec — including magic such as `:(exclude)...` — executed by git itself, and
  pathspecs are interpreted relative to the repository root regardless of the invoking directory.
  The recorded set is
  order-independent (sorted, deduped, trailing slashes normalized on plain paths) and is part of
  the captured revision's identity: the same range captured under a different scope is a different
  revision, while identical captured content still shares one content object. A scope that matches
  no changed files is an error unless `--allow-empty` is passed; with `--allow-empty`, the empty
  revision still records the requested scope. The scope is visible in `pointbreak revision show`,
  `pointbreak revision list`, and `pointbreak history` under
  `source.pathspecs`; an unscoped capture carries no `pathspecs` key and its identity is unchanged
  from before the option existed. (This is deliberately git pathspec syntax, not the
  gitignore-style globs of `.pointbreak/sensitivity.json` — capture scoping is executed by git, while
  the sensitivity exclude config is matched by Pointbreak at scan time.)
- `git_tree`, `git_index`, and `git_working_tree` are endpoint states in the recorded model. The
  source selector decides which endpoint pair is captured: default worktree (`HEAD` or empty tree to
  working tree), committed range (`commit` to `commit`), root (`empty tree` to `commit`), staged
  (`commit` or empty tree to `index`), or unstaged (`index` to `working tree`).

V1 storage is local and synchronous. The shared common-dir store may take concurrent writes from
multiple worktrees of the same clone, kept safe by content-addressed writes and a regenerable
projection rather than a lock. V1 does not add a daemon, delivery queue, approval flow, async
storage, remote storage, or note mutation.

By default every worktree of a clone resolves the shared common-dir store at `<git-common-dir>/pointbreak`, so
`pointbreak capture` lands its capture directly there — no setup step — and the capture is
immediately visible to `revision list`, `revision show`, and `history` from any sibling worktree. An
`ephemeral` worktree instead captures into its own discardable `.pointbreak/data/` store (see
[`pointbreak store`](#pointbreak-store)).

The native review write commands — `pointbreak observation add`, `pointbreak input-request open`
and `respond`, `pointbreak assessment add`, and `pointbreak validation add` — behave the same
way. They resolve the shared common-dir store, so you can record a
fact against a revision (or related observation, assessment, or request) captured in a sibling
worktree, and the fact lands directly in that shared store, visible to every worktree in place. An
`ephemeral` worktree writes the fact to its own `.pointbreak/data/` store, unchanged.

## `pointbreak store`

```bash
pointbreak store status [--repo <path>] [--format <fmt>] [--show-paths]
pointbreak store paths [--repo <path>] [--format <fmt>]
pointbreak store mode (shared | ephemeral | show) [--repo <path>] [--format <fmt>]
pointbreak store migrate [--repo <path>] [--include-ephemeral] [--retire-source] [--format <fmt>]
pointbreak store link [<slug>] [--repo <path>] [--include-ephemeral] [--include-sensitive] [--retire-source] [--format <fmt>]
pointbreak store unlink [--repo <path>] [--format <fmt>]
pointbreak store forget <slug> [--yes] [--force] [--format <fmt>]
pointbreak store list [--format <fmt>]
pointbreak store remove [--repo <path>] (--snapshot <id> | --revision <id> | --ref <name> | --range <a>..<b> | --unreachable) [--sign-key <key>] [--format <fmt>]
pointbreak store gc [--repo <path>] [--format <fmt>]
pointbreak store compact [--repo <path>] [--format <fmt>]
```

`pointbreak store` commands inspect, configure, and maintain the review store the current Git worktree
resolves. By default every worktree of a clone — the main worktree and every linked worktree alike —
resolves the same **shared common-dir store** at `<git-common-dir>/pointbreak` (the path under the repo's Git common
directory), automatically and with no setup step. Because linked worktrees share one Git common
directory, a capture in any worktree is immediately visible from its siblings. By default this is a
per-clone store, not a user-level multi-repository store or remote sync service; a clone can opt into
the machine-wide **user-level family store tier** with `pointbreak store link` (see below).

`pointbreak store status` resolves the store and emits `pointbreak.store-status` JSON.

`pointbreak store paths` is the supported path-discovery seam. It emits
`pointbreak.store-paths` version 1 with the selected `tier` and exact `worktreeStore`, `commonStore`,
`binding`, `home`, and `keys` paths. The binding is
`<git-common-dir>/pointbreak.link.json`; the common store is
`<git-common-dir>/pointbreak`. Linked worktrees share both through their Git common directory. Use
this command in scripts instead of reconstructing Pointbreak paths.

- `mode` is `local` (the clone-local common-dir store), `ephemeral` (a worktree pinned to its
  discardable `.pointbreak/data`), or `user-level` (a clone linked to a family store). `storeRef` is
  `local` for the first two and the family slug for `user-level`. A `user-level` status additionally
  carries `repositoryFamilyRef`, `cloneRef`, `liveCloneCount`, `orphaned`, and `lastWrite`; the other
  two tiers omit them. These family fields sit outside the frozen hard core under this document's
  tiered stability promise.
- `storeIdentity` and `contextIdentity` are opaque, machine-local identifiers for the resolved store
  and current worktree context. Consumers may compare them for equality but must not parse them. Nested
  paths in one worktree report the same pair; linked worktrees sharing a store have the same
  `storeIdentity` and different `contextIdentity` values.
- `inventory` reports `eventCount`, `eventBytes`, `artifactCount`, `artifactBytes`, `totalBytes`,
  optional `untrackedBytes`, `largestArtifacts`, and `revisionObjects`. Artifact entries use
  opaque artifact refs rather than filesystem paths. Each `revisionObjects` entry carries a
  `revisionIds` **list** (sourced from the `work_object_proposed` events keyed by `objectId` plus
  `objectArtifactContentHash`), because one object artifact may be referenced by several revisions
  under the shared-store model (#146), while a rebased recapture can store another artifact for the
  same stable object id.
- `sensitivity` reports `policyOutcome` plus redacted findings. Finding references use
  `file:sha256:*` refs, and the JSON document never prints secret values or source file paths. The
  local-only `--show-paths` flag is the one exception, and only on the text lane — see
  [Sensitivity exclude globs](#sensitivity-exclude-globs).

Sensitivity findings are reported but do not currently abort a write. A hard-blocking policy and
explicit override controls are a forward-looking note for when movement can target a wider store;
blocking findings still name only safe finding kinds, such as `known_token`, and command output does
not print the secret text or file path.

Every review read command resolves the shared common-dir store: `revision list` and `revision show`,
`history`, the observation, input-request, and validation lists, the association list, and
`assessment show` read it from any worktree of the clone, including hydrated bodies and the captured
snapshot, so their `eventCount` and `eventSetHash` reflect that one store.

`pointbreak store mode` reads or sets a per-worktree store mode that controls where the worktree's review
data lands. `pointbreak store mode ephemeral` pins the worktree to a discardable worktree-local
`.pointbreak/data` store — the privacy escape hatch for sensitive or throwaway work whose bytes should
disappear when the worktree is removed. `pointbreak store mode shared` (the default) uses the shared
common-dir store. The mode is written to a committed `.pointbreak/store.json`, and may be overridden
privately by a git-excluded `.pointbreak/store.local.json` (the local file wins, the
`delegates.json` / `delegates.local.json` precedent). A malformed or unsupported config is a hard
error rather than a silent fallback. `pointbreak store mode show` reports the resolved mode without changing
it. All three forms emit `pointbreak.store-mode` JSON with `mode` (`shared` | `ephemeral`) and `source`
(`default` | `committed` | `local`); the body embeds no storage path.

### Sensitivity exclude globs

The worktree sensitivity scan (run by `pointbreak store status` and `pointbreak store migrate`'s consent
gate) supports a committed **`.pointbreak/sensitivity.json`** plus a git-excluded
**`.pointbreak/sensitivity.local.json`** (covered by `.pointbreak/.gitignore`'s `*.local.json` line) listing
path globs the scan skips — the targeted alternative to the blanket `--include-ephemeral` override
when a repo's own test fixtures carry scanner-triggering strings:

```json
{
  "schema": "shore.sensitivity-config",
  "version": 1,
  "excludeGlobs": ["tests/**", "src/session/store/sensitivity.rs"]
}
```

The two files merge by **union** (committed order first, then novel local entries) — deliberately
diverging from the local-replaces-committed rule `store.json`/`delegates.json` use, because this is
a *list*: replace would force copying the whole committed list to add one local entry, union grants
nothing replace couldn't, and the audit counts make any widening visible. Default is empty (scan
everything; opt-in only).

Glob semantics are a documented gitignore-style subset matched against the repo-relative path: a
leading `/` or any interior `/` makes the pattern rooted (`tests/**`, `src/lib.rs`); a slash-free
pattern matches any path component at any depth (`*.pem`, `data`); a trailing `/` marks a directory
pattern matching only paths inside it; `**` spans segments (zero or more interior, one or more
trailing); `*` and `?` never cross `/`. Negation (`!`), empty patterns, and malformed or
unsupported-version config are hard errors naming the offending file — the config gates a
protection, so a misread never silently changes coverage.

An excluded path is **not scanned** — an explicit operator opt-out, kept honest by the audit
surfaces: `pointbreak store status` reports `sensitivity.excludedPathCount` and
`sensitivity.excludeGlobs[{glob, matched}]` (zero-count globs included; a dead glob is itself worth
seeing), and `pointbreak store migrate` reports `sensitivityExcludedPathCount` whenever its gate scan
ran (absent under `--include-ephemeral`, which skips the scan). Excluded paths themselves are never
listed — the scan's redacted `file:sha256:*` posture stands. The gate behavior is unchanged: a
`block` finding outside the excludes still refuses without `--include-ephemeral`.

**Seeing which files matched (`pointbreak store status --show-paths`).** A finding names only its *kind*
and a redacted `file:sha256:*` reference, so on its own it does not tell you which file to exclude.
`--show-paths` closes that loop: it re-runs the same scan (the same matchers, the same exclude
globs) locally and lists the real matched worktree paths grouped by finding kind, so you can author
a targeted `excludeGlobs` entry. The `link`/`migrate` sensitivity gate errors point at this command.

`--show-paths` is **text-only**: it forces the text lane and refuses an explicit `--format json` /
`--format json-pretty`. That restriction is deliberately **not a security barrier** —
the listing prints to your own terminal, the paths are your own local files, and plain text is as
machine-readable as JSON, so nothing is being withheld from a program. It exists only to keep the
versioned `pointbreak.store-status` JSON document a single, uniformly path-free shape, so a tool that
pipes that document into a log, an index, or a relay never depends on a flag to stay path-free. The
redaction that genuinely matters is on the **stored and forwarded** data — the events written to
`<git-common-dir>/pointbreak` and the default `pointbreak.store-status` document, which can cross machine, family-store,
and relay boundaries and would otherwise leak your local filesystem layout to whoever reads the
store. `--show-paths` never writes to the store or emits JSON, so it sits outside that contract by
construction: the type that carries the real paths is not serializable, and the paths reach nothing
but stdout.

A pre-flip worktree-local `.pointbreak/data` store on a non-ephemeral worktree (data written before the
shared common-dir default) is detected on any read or write and errors with a hint to run
`pointbreak store migrate`. `pointbreak store migrate` folds that legacy store into the shared common-dir store
**non-destructively** by default: it copies events and artifacts forward and leaves `.pointbreak/data` in
place, so you can verify the result and then remove `.pointbreak/data` yourself to finish the switch. It
is idempotent (re-running reports the already-present facts as existing), and it refuses an ephemeral
or sensitivity-flagged worktree unless you pass `--include-ephemeral`.

**`--retire-source`** completes the switch in one command: after the fold, an independent
verification walks every durable file in the source store (`events/` and `artifacts/`, recursively;
only in-flight `*.tmp` files are excluded — the regenerable store-root `state.json` sits outside
those trees, and a nested file merely named `state.json` is verified like any other) and requires each to be
present in the shared store with identical content — byte-identical for artifacts, canonically
identical modulo the import's own ingest-provenance stamp for events. Only then is `.pointbreak/data`
deleted, so the very next read resolves. On **any** missing or divergent file — including an orphan
artifact no event references, which the fold deliberately does not carry — the command errors,
names the offending paths, and deletes nothing. A source with no durable files at all (only the store-root
`state.json` or the empty directories the writer pre-creates) is removed as a husk without a fold;
a source holding artifact files but no event files is refused outright. Classification is by file
counts, never directory existence.

It emits `pointbreak.store-migrate` JSON with `eventsCreated`, `eventsExisting`, `artifactsCreated`,
`artifactsExisting`, `sourceEmpty`, `sourceRetired`, `verifiedEvents`, and `verifiedArtifacts`.
(This is distinct from the legacy flat `.pointbreak/` layout, a retired pre-1.0 format that is detected
and refused rather than migrated; see
[storage-model.md](./storage-model.md#migrations-and-doctor).)

`pointbreak store link [<slug>]` promotes this clone into the opt-in **user-level family store** at
`<pointbreak-home-root>/stores/<slug>/`, a per-machine store shared across independent clones of the same
repository family so review facts survive removing any one clone. The binding is recorded **per
physical clone** in the git common dir (`pointbreak.link.json` under `.git/`), so it never travels in a
commit and a single `pointbreak store link` binds the main checkout and every current and future
`git worktree` of that clone. The per-worktree `.pointbreak/store.local.json` file is mode-only:
a `familyRef` or `cloneRef` there is rejected with guidance to run `pointbreak store link <slug>`.
A worktree can still opt out locally with `pointbreak store mode ephemeral`. When a worktree writes
to its clone-local store while a sibling worktree of the same clone is linked, `pointbreak store
status` and `pointbreak capture` surface a one-line advisory pointing at `pointbreak store link
<slug>` — the split is signalled, never silent. Before any family write,
`link` runs its gates in order: it refuses an ephemeral worktree (override `--include-ephemeral`) and
a sensitivity-flagged worktree (override `--include-sensitive`), refuses a slug already stamped for a
different family, and warns (without blocking) on a sync-managed filesystem path or when the clone
shares no git history with an existing family. It then folds the clone-local `<git-common-dir>/pointbreak` history
forward with independent verification and flips the binding last, so an interrupted link leaves the
clone still resolving its clone-local store. Omitting `<slug>` fails with a suggestion rather than
picking one silently. `--retire-source` deletes the clone-local store only after the fold is
verified. When the fold carries prior unsigned `pointbreak store remove` events, a diagnostic discloses
that they lost possession-based suppression and should be re-issued in the family store. It emits
`pointbreak.store-link` JSON (`familyRef`, `cloneRef`, `createdFamily`, the `folded*` counts,
`sourceRetired`, and any warnings). `pointbreak store unlink` detaches this clone (clearing the binding
and deregistering it) without moving any data, and survives a family store that was already forgotten.

`pointbreak store forget <slug>` is the whole-store destructive verb for a family store, deliberately
outside `pointbreak store remove`'s content-targeted removal (no store survives a forget to hold a removal
event). It is dry-run by default: it previews the inventory and live-clone count that would be lost
and deletes nothing. `--yes` performs the deletion, but only for a family with zero live clones (an
**orphaned** family store — a different notion from `pointbreak store remove --unreachable`, which targets
unreachable-commit content); a family with live clones additionally requires `--force`. `pointbreak store
list` is the one repo-less surface: it takes no `--repo` flag, never resolves a git repo, and walks
`<pointbreak-home-root>/stores/` reporting each family's `familyRef`, inventory, `liveCloneCount`,
`orphaned` flag, and `lastWrite`. Against an empty home it returns an empty `families` array.

`pointbreak store remove` retires content-addressed artifacts from the store. It resolves exactly one
selector to a set of content hashes — `--snapshot <id>` (a snapshot's bound artifact), `--revision
<id>` (every artifact a revision references), `--ref <name>` / `--range <a>..<b>` (artifacts of
revisions anchored on the named commit or commit range), or `--unreachable` (artifacts of commit-anchored
revisions whose commits are all unreachable from live refs; `--orphans` is a deprecated alias) — and
records one removal fact per content hash. It emits
`pointbreak.store-remove` JSON listing each `contentHash`, whether it was newly `created`, and
`coReferencingUnits` (other revisions that still name the same shared artifact, reported before the
removal), plus `eventsCreated` and `eventsExisting`. Removal is content-targeted and idempotent:
re-removing a hash reports `created: false`. Removal is a write, so a signed store stays signed —
`--sign-key` selects the signing key exactly as `pointbreak capture` does. There is deliberately no
`--idempotency-key`; the removal key is derived solely from the content hash. Removal records the
fact; it does not delete bytes — run `pointbreak store gc` / `pointbreak store compact` to reclaim them.

`pointbreak store gc` and `pointbreak store compact` are the same local sweep: they physically delete the
content-addressed blobs whose content hash has been removed, reclaiming disk. The sweep records no
event and is fully re-derivable from the log — re-capturing the same content re-materializes the blob.
It emits `pointbreak.store-compact` JSON listing each swept blob's `contentHash` and `outcome`
(`removed` or `missing`) plus `bytesReclaimed`. Running it again is a no-op (every removed blob is
already `missing`).

Removed content renders as an explained state on every read surface, never as an error. For
note-shaped bodies (observation and input-request bodies, response reasons, assessment and
validation summaries, imported note bodies), `pointbreak revision show`, the leaf `list`/`fetch`/`show`
commands, and `pointbreak history` omit the body text and carry a `bodyContentState` /
`summaryContentState` / `reasonContentState` field beside the content hash — `suppressed_present`
while the bytes are still stored (a compact would reclaim them) or `physically_removed` after the
sweep — plus `body_content_suppressed_present` / `body_content_physically_removed` diagnostics.
The field is omitted entirely while content is present, and a body that is missing *without* a
recorded removal still fails the read with the `import referenced artifacts` guidance.

Command output is the machine-integration surface, under the tiered stability promise described at
the [top of this reference](#cli-reference) (a frozen hard core; an additive-evolvable soft shell).
Raw store paths, event files, artifact paths, `.git` paths, `.pointbreak/data` paths, and `state.json`
remain internal storage details.

## `pointbreak identity`

```bash
# Preview the actor that repository writes will use (pointbreak.identity-whoami).
pointbreak identity whoami [--repo .] [--format <fmt>]

# Stage a delegation record binding an agent to its responsible principal (pointbreak.identity-delegate).
pointbreak identity delegate <agent-actor-id> --principal <principal-actor-id> \
  [--from <RFC3339>] [--until <RFC3339>] [--comment <text>] [--local] [--repo .] [--format <fmt>]

# Stage an actor-attributes entry — kind + roles — for any actor (pointbreak.identity-attest).
pointbreak identity attest <actor-id> --kind <kind> [--role <role>]... \
  [--comment <text>] [--local] [--repo .] [--format <fmt>]
```

`pointbreak identity whoami` previews the writer identity that the existing resolver will use. It honors
`POINTBREAK_ACTOR_ID`, then Git email, Git name, and finally `actor:local`; it accepts no actor override.
Its v1 JSON is exactly `schema`, `version`, and `actorId`.

The other `pointbreak identity` commands write the actor/principal config the read side (above) resolves.
Both are possession-style: they stage the working-tree edit only and never invoke git — review and
commit the file to apply it (`git log -p` is the audit trail), exactly like `pointbreak key enroll`.

- **`delegate`** stages a delegation record into `.pointbreak/delegates.json` binding `<agent-actor-id>` (an
  `actor:agent:<name>` id) to a responsible **non-agent** `--principal` (the human/actor that answers
  for the agent; the depth-0 rule rejects an agent principal). `--from` defaults to now in RFC 3339 UTC;
  `--until` defaults to an open window; `--comment` is free text for diff readers. Emits a
  `pointbreak.identity-delegate` document and a stderr hint to commit.
- **`attest`** stages an actor-attributes entry into `.pointbreak/actor-attributes.json` for `<actor-id>`
  (any persisted actor id). `--kind` is required — exactly one kind per actor; the reserved well-known
  kinds are `human`, `agent`, `service`, and `reviewer-model`, but any lowercase-kebab token is
  accepted. `--role` is repeatable; kind and roles are normalized to lowercase-kebab and roles are
  deduped + sorted. Re-attesting **replaces** the actor's entry (kind, roles, and comment) — it is not
  additive. Emits a `pointbreak.identity-attest` document.
- **`--local`** writes the private `.local.json` sibling instead of the committed file and git-excludes
  it via the generated, committed `.pointbreak/.gitignore` (its `*.local.json` line covers every private
  override). The layers merge git-config style: a local entry **fully replaces** the
  committed entry for that key on this machine (never a merge), and the command surfaces that
  full-replace caveat on stderr.
- `--repo` (default `.`) may be the repository root or a path inside it; the entry always lands at the
  worktree-root `.pointbreak/`. Inputs are validated against the same grammar the readers enforce, so a
  staged file always re-reads and a rejected input writes nothing.

The delegation-map format is documented in [storage-model.md](./storage-model.md); the models and
decisions are in [ADR-0010](./adr/adr-0010-actor-identity-and-delegation.md) (delegation) and
[ADR-0012](./adr/adr-0012-actor-attributes-and-roles.md) (actor attributes).

## `pointbreak key`

Manage the user-level signing keystore and stage signer enrollment. Keys live in `~/.pointbreak/keys/`
(honoring `$XDG_DATA_HOME` on Unix and `%APPDATA%\pointbreak` on Windows; `POINTBREAK_HOME` overrides) — never
in the repo `.pointbreak/` or the store. See [storage-model.md](./storage-model.md) for the key home and
allowed-signers format.

```bash
# Generate a human signing key and print its did:key (pointbreak.key-init).
pointbreak key init --name default

# List local keys with enrollment status and which is the default (pointbreak.key-list).
pointbreak key list --repo .

# Discover local Git/OpenSSH signing evidence (pointbreak.key-discover).
# Discovery only suggests reviewed next steps.
pointbreak key discover --repo .

# Print a key's did:key and/or raw public key (pointbreak.key-show).
pointbreak key show default --did
pointbreak key show default --pubkey

# Adopt an existing SSH Ed25519 key as an agent-backed signer (pointbreak.key-use-ssh).
# Reuses ssh-agent custody — no new key material. Parallel to `init`.
pointbreak key use-ssh ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub --name default
pointbreak key use-ssh 'key::ssh-ed25519 AAAA…'   # git user.signingKey literal form

# Stage an allow-list entry binding a key's did:key to an actor (pointbreak.key-enroll).
# Possession-style: this stages the working-tree .pointbreak/allowed-signers.json edit only;
# review and commit it to authorize the binding.
pointbreak key enroll default --actor actor:agent:claude-code --repo .
pointbreak key enroll --signer did:key:z6Mk... --actor actor:git-email:alice@example.com --repo .
```

`init` refuses to overwrite an existing named key. `use-ssh` adopts an existing SSH **public** key as an
agent-backed `default` signer: it accepts a `*.pub` path or a `key::ssh-ed25519 AAAA…` literal, emits a
`pointbreak.key-use-ssh` document with the derived `did:key` (the same `.didKey` field `pointbreak key show
--did` prints) plus an enrollment hint, and (like `init`) refuses to overwrite. Only plain `ssh-ed25519`
keys are accepted; `ed25519-sk`/RSA/ECDSA are rejected with a clear error pointing at `pointbreak key init`.
`discover` reads local Git/OpenSSH signing evidence and emits a `pointbreak.key-discover` document:
`candidates[]` includes `source`, `signerId`, `keyArgument`, `suggestedName`, `actorHints`,
matching `localKeys`, matching `enrolledActors`, the `resolvedActor` used for suggestions, and
advisory `commands`; `diagnostics[]` reports non-fatal missing or unsupported evidence with source
details. Suggested commands describe unmet setup only: an already adopted signer is not offered a
duplicate `use-ssh` alias, and an already authorized actor/signer pair is not offered a redundant
`enroll` command. This discovery does not authorize keys, does not write the key home, and does not
stage `.pointbreak/allowed-signers.json`. Review a candidate, optionally adopt public key custody with
`pointbreak key use-ssh`, then stage reviewed trust with `pointbreak key enroll --signer <did:key> --actor
<actor> --repo .`.

`list`/`enroll`/`discover` take `--repo` (default `.`) to resolve the committed
`.pointbreak/allowed-signers.json` or local Git/OpenSSH evidence.
Enrollment never commits — the human's commit is the authorization.

Each **write** subcommand (`capture`, `observation add`, `assessment add`,
`validation add`, `association record`/`withdraw`, `input-request open`/`respond`)
accepts `--sign-key <name|path>` to
sign that write with a specific key (highest precedence; overrides `POINTBREAK_SIGNING_KEY`). A key that
cannot be loaded leaves the write unsigned at exit 0 with an advisory diagnostic — signing never
blocks. An agent-backed key resolves through an identities-only ssh-agent pre-flight; if the agent is
unavailable (`signing_agent_unavailable`), does not hold the key (`signing_agent_key_absent`), or fails
the real sign (`signing_agent_sign_failed`), the write is left unsigned at exit 0 — see
[signing-ux.md](./signing-ux.md) for the full never-gates table. This never-gates behavior covers the
ordinary signed review writes listed above; `pointbreak endorse` is the exception, where an
unresolved signer is a hard error rather than an unsigned write. Only shipped subcommands are listed;
`rotate` and `revoke` are named follow-ons, not yet available.

## `pointbreak observation`

```bash
pointbreak observation add --track <track-id> --title <title> \
  [--revision <revision-id> | --exact-revision <revision-id>] [target options] \
  [--body-content-type text/plain|text/markdown] \
  [--tag <tag>]... [--confidence low|medium|high] [--supersedes <observation-id>]... \
  [--responds-to <observation-id>]...
pointbreak observation list [--revision <revision-id>] [--track <track-id>] \
  [--file <path>] [--tag <tag>] [--include-body] [--format <fmt>]
```

Observations are append-only review notes for a captured revision.

- `observation add` requires `--track` and `--title`.
- `--revision` is a head seed: a superseded revision resolves forward to the unique current head of
  its thread. `--exact-revision` targets the named revision without following supersession. The two
  options are mutually exclusive. Without either, the command defaults to the single captured
  revision in the current worktree scope and errors when none or multiple are in scope.
- Tracks are review lanes, not actor or producer provenance.
- Without `--file`, the observation targets the whole revision.
- With `--file <path>`, it targets a captured file.
- With `--file <path> --start-line <n> [--end-line <n>]`, it targets a range on `--side <old|new>`
  where the default side is `new`.
- Bodies may come from `--body`, `--body-file`, or `--body-stdin`.
- `--body-content-type` defaults to `text/plain`; use `text/markdown` when the body should render
  as Markdown in the inspector.
- Large bodies are stored as Pointbreak-owned `shore.note-body` artifacts while command output keeps
  artifact paths private.
- `--supersedes <observation-id>` (repeatable) records a correction by appending a new observation
  that names the older observation.
- `--responds-to <observation-id>` (repeatable) records that this observation responds to an
  existing observation — a fact-to-fact relationship (a derived `responded_by` back-pointer is
  surfaced on the target). It does not supersede or mutate the target.
- `--confidence <low|medium|high>` records an optional confidence level on the observation.
- `--tag <tag>` (repeatable) attaches free-form tags used by the `observation list` `--tag` filter.
- `observation list` replays durable events for the revision and may filter by revision, track,
  file, or tag. It hydrates body text only with `--include-body`.

Output is compact `pointbreak.review-observation-add` or `pointbreak.review-observation-list` JSON by
default.

## `pointbreak input-request`

```bash
pointbreak input-request open --track <track-id> --title <title> --reason <reason> \
  [--revision <revision-id>] [--mode operative|advisory] \
  [--body-content-type text/plain|text/markdown]
pointbreak input-request list [--revision <revision-id>] [--track <track-id>] \
  [--mode operative|advisory] [--file <path>] [--status open|responded|ambiguous|all] \
  [--include-body] [--format <fmt>]
pointbreak input-request show <input-request-id> [--include-body]
pointbreak input-request respond <input-request-id> --outcome <outcome> [reason options] \
  [--reason-content-type text/plain|text/markdown]
```

Input requests are durable pause or decision requests for a captured revision.

- `input-request open` requires `--track`, `--title`, and `--reason`.
- `--reason` classifies the ask. Values: `ambiguous-state`, `unsafe-action`, `stale-revision`,
  `failed-gate`, `external-side-effect`, `conflicting-event`, `missing-permission`,
  `manual-decision-required`, `insufficient-evidence`. `insufficient-evidence` types an ask for more
  evidence — a debugger or CI run can satisfy it with validation evidence. The set grows additively
  within `version:1` (a new value is appended, not a `version` bump); see the hard-core note above.
- `--revision` pins the request to one captured revision. Without either, the command defaults to the single captured revision and errors if
  multiple captured revisions exist.
- `--mode` defaults to `operative`; `advisory` requests are durable and visible but do not imply a
  cooperative client must pause. The `mode` (`operative`/`advisory`) and `reasonCode` values surface
  on the consumed `input-request list` field-paths, so — like the response outcomes below — they are
  part of the frozen hard core: stable within `version:1`, changed only by a coordinated `version`
  bump.
- Targets mirror observations: review-wide by default, captured file, captured range, or an
  existing native observation through `--observation <observation-id>`.
- Request bodies may come from `--body`, `--body-file`, or `--body-stdin`.
- `--body-content-type` defaults to `text/plain`; use `text/markdown` when the request body should
  render as Markdown in the inspector.
- Large request bodies reuse Pointbreak-owned `shore.note-body` artifacts while command output keeps
  artifact paths private.
- `input-request list` is the V1 polling read surface and defaults to open requests. It may filter
  by revision, track, mode, file, or status, and hydrates body text only with `--include-body`.
- `input-request show <id> --include-body` returns one request and hydrates the body when
  requested.
- `input-request respond <id>` appends an `input_request_responded` event.
- Response reasons may use `--reason-content-type text/markdown`; the default is `text/plain`.
- Response outcomes are `approved`, `rejected`, `dismissed`, `superseded`, and `abandoned`. These
  wire values are part of the frozen hard core (review-loop drivers branch on them): stable within
  `version:1`, changed only by a coordinated `version` bump.

Output documents are compact `pointbreak.review-input-request-open`,
`pointbreak.review-input-request-list`, `pointbreak.review-input-request-show`, and
`pointbreak.review-input-request-respond` JSON by default.

V1 is durable and polling-friendly. It does not add a daemon, filesystem watch mode, TUI prompt,
notification transport, or cancellation/escalation event.

## `pointbreak assessment`

```bash
pointbreak assessment add --track <track-id> --assessment <assessment> \
  [--revision <revision-id> | --exact-revision <revision-id>] [target options] \
  [--summary-content-type text/plain|text/markdown]
pointbreak assessment show [--revision <revision-id> | --exact-revision <revision-id>] \
  [--all] [--track <track-id>] \
  [--include-summary] [--format <fmt>]
```

Assessments record review calls for a captured revision.

- `assessment add` requires `--track` and `--assessment`.
- `--revision` is a head seed: a superseded revision resolves forward to the unique current head of
  its thread. `--exact-revision` targets the named revision without following supersession. The two
  options are mutually exclusive. Without either, the command defaults to the single captured
  revision in the current worktree scope and errors when none or multiple are in scope.
- CLI input uses `kebab-case` assessment values: `accepted`, `accepted-with-follow-up`,
  `needs-changes`, and `needs-clarification`. Command JSON output uses the matching `snake_case`
  values: `accepted`, `accepted_with_follow_up`, `needs_changes`, and `needs_clarification`. The
  `snake_case` wire values are part of the frozen hard core (review-loop drivers branch on them):
  stable within `version:1`, changed only by a coordinated `version` bump.
- Targets mirror the revision ledger: review-wide by default, captured file, captured range,
  native observation, native input request, or another assessment.
- Summaries may come from `--summary`, `--summary-file`, or `--summary-stdin`.
- `--summary-content-type` defaults to `text/plain`; use `text/markdown` when the summary should
  render as Markdown in the inspector.
- Large summaries reuse Pointbreak-owned `shore.note-body` artifacts while command output keeps
  artifact paths private.
- `--replaces <assessment-id>` is the only V1 relationship that removes an older assessment from
  the current set.
- `--related-observation` and `--related-input-request` record evidence links; they do not mutate
  observations or close input requests.
- `assessment show` reports current status as `unassessed`, `resolved`, or `ambiguous`. It may
  filter by revision or track, include replaced assessments with `--all`, and hydrate summaries
  with `--include-summary`.

Output documents are compact `pointbreak.review-assessment-add` and `pointbreak.review-assessment-show` JSON
by default.

State-change outcomes such as deferred, split-out, overridden, and superseded are ordinary review
observations when needed.

## `pointbreak attention`

```bash
pointbreak attention list [--repo <path>] [--revision <revision-id>] [--format <fmt>]
```

`attention list` is a read-only projection of the review record's outstanding, judgment-needing
state — the first product surface of "Pointbreak surfaces the moments that need judgment." It
guides, never gates (ADR-0019): nothing here is a write precondition. The emitted document is
`pointbreak.attention-list`, version 1.

- `--repo` defaults to `.`; `--revision` scopes the read to one revision — its anchored items plus
  the competing-heads thread that covers it (a short id resolves via the shared id resolver).
- Each item carries a kind-qualified `id`, a `tier` (`primary` or `secondary`), the anchoring
  `revisionId` (absent only for thread-scoped `competing_heads`), a supersession-derived
  `freshness` block, an `observedAt` stamp, and a `kind`-tagged detail. Items sort by tier, then
  oldest `observedAt` first, then `id`.
- Item kinds:
  - `open_input_request` — an open ask (operative → `primary`, advisory → `secondary`).
  - `ambiguous_assessment` — more than one current assessment on a revision, carried as peers;
    on a superseded revision the item resolves once every successor head has been re-judged.
  - `competing_heads` — a supersession thread with two or more current heads. `headRevisionIds` is
    sorted for determinism, **not** a priority ranking.
  - `stale_assessment` — a current assessment anchored to a superseded revision, until every
    current head of the thread has been re-judged. `headRevisionIds` names that complete current
    head set; `freshness.supersededBy` continues to name direct superseders only.
  - `failed_validation` — the latest failed/errored check per `(revision, track, checkName)` on a
    current head; a strictly-later passing rerun clears it (`skipped` never clears), and so does
    a later, unanimously accepting judgment on the revision (ADR-0019's judgment-subsumption
    amendment).
  - `follow_up_outstanding` — an accepted-with-follow-up assessment whose linked requests are still
    open.
- This document is entirely soft shell: no field-path here joins the ADR-0029 hard core.

## `pointbreak validation`

```bash
pointbreak validation add --track <track-id> --check-name <name> --status <status> \
  [--revision <revision-id> | --exact-revision <revision-id>] [validation options] \
  [--summary-content-type text/plain|text/markdown]
pointbreak validation list [--revision <revision-id>] \
  [--track <track-id>] [--status <status>] [--include-body] [--format <fmt>]
```

Validation checks record local test, lint, build, or other verification evidence for a captured
revision. They are advisory review context only: they do not accept, reject, merge, block, or
replace a review assessment.

- `validation add` requires `--track`, `--check-name`, and `--status`.
- `--revision` is a head seed: a superseded revision resolves forward to the unique current head of
  its thread. `--exact-revision` targets the named revision without following supersession. The two
  options are mutually exclusive. Without either, the command defaults to the single captured
  revision in the current worktree scope and errors when none or multiple are in scope.
- Validation targets are revision-only. There are no file or path target flags.
- Status values are `passed`, `failed`, `errored`, and `skipped`.
- `--command`, `--exit-code`, `--source-fingerprint`, `--started-at`, `--completed-at`, and
  repeatable `--log-content-hash` record evidence metadata without exposing artifact paths.
- `--trigger` defaults to `manual`; accepted values are `manual`, `push`, and `pull-request`.
- Summaries may come from `--summary`, `--summary-file`, or `--summary-stdin`.
- `--summary-content-type` defaults to `text/plain`; use `text/markdown` when the summary should
  render as Markdown in the inspector.
- Large summaries reuse Pointbreak-owned `shore.note-body` artifacts while command output keeps
  artifact paths private.
- `validation list` replays durable events for the revision and may filter by revision, track,
  or status. It hydrates summaries only with `--include-body`.

Output documents are compact `pointbreak.review-validation-add` and
`pointbreak.review-validation-list` JSON by default.

## `pointbreak endorse`

```bash
pointbreak endorse <target-event-id> [--sign-key <name|path>] [--actor <id>] [--repo .] [--format <fmt>]
```

`pointbreak endorse` records a detached co-signature (an endorsement) over an existing target event —
for example a captured revision's `work_object_proposed` event. The resolved signer is the attesting
signer and the carrier's envelope writer is the **endorser's own actor** (`--actor`, else the resolved
writing identity), never the target's author.

- **Unsigned is a hard error.** Unlike every other write — where signing never gates — an endorsement
  has no unsigned form, because the signature *is* its content. The signer is resolved first (before the
  target); if none resolves (`POINTBREAK_SIGNING=off`, no key, an unreadable key), the command exits non-zero
  and writes nothing. Signer precedence otherwise follows the **Signing** rules above.
- Idempotent: re-endorsing the same target with the same signer is a no-op (`eventsCreated: 0`,
  `eventsExisting: 1`, same carrier `eventId`).
- The emitted `pointbreak.review-endorse` document reports carrier facts (`eventId`, `targetEventId`,
  `targetEventRecordHash`, `attestingSigner`, `actorId`, and write counts) — **not** a trust verdict.
  Whether an endorsement classifies as trusted is reader-relative (resolved against the reader's
  allow-list at read time), not stamped at write time.

The endorsement record and its read-side classification are decided in
[ADR-0013](./adr/adr-0013-endorsement-record-and-classification.md).

## `pointbreak association`

```bash
pointbreak association record --track <track-id> (--commit <rev> | --ref <name> --head <oid>) \
  [--revision <revision-id>] [--sign-key <name|path>] [--repo <path>]
pointbreak association withdraw <association-id> --track <track-id> \
  [--revision <revision-id>] [--sign-key <name|path>] [--repo <path>]
pointbreak association list [--revision <revision-id>] [--axis commit|ref] [--current] \
  [--repo <path>] [--format <fmt>]
```

`pointbreak association` records and withdraws the commit-graph associations of a captured
revision as append-only associate/withdraw events on two axes — commit and ref. This is how a
revision is tied to the commits and branches that carry it; recording a landed commit
(`record --commit`) is the association half of the ADR-0014 lifecycle
([ADR-0014](./adr/adr-0014-reviewunit-commit-range-lifecycle.md)).

- **`record`** takes exactly one axis. `--commit <rev>` (resolved to an OID) binds the revision on
  the commit axis; `--ref <name>` (a short branch name is normalized to its full ref) at the
  explicit `--head <oid>` (never inferred) binds it on the ref axis. `--commit` and `--ref` are
  mutually exclusive, and `--ref` requires `--head`.
- **`withdraw <association-id>`** retracts an earlier association by its id. The id is positional
  and must carry its prefix — `assoc-commit:…` or `assoc-ref:…` — because the prefix selects which
  axis is withdrawn; a prefixed short form like `assoc-commit:<hex-fragment>` resolves against the
  store. Withdrawal is terminal: a later re-association of the same target does not revive the
  withdrawn edge.
- Both writes are signable — `--sign-key <name|path>` selects the signing key exactly as
  `pointbreak capture` does, and signing never gates the write.
- `--revision <revision-id>` pins the target revision; without it the command defaults to the single
  captured revision and errors if multiple captured revisions exist.
- **`list`** reports both axes unless `--axis commit|ref` narrows to one, and `--current` excludes
  withdrawn associations, showing only what currently holds. It emits `pointbreak.review-association-list`
  JSON.
- The write forms emit `pointbreak.review-association-commit`, `pointbreak.review-association-commit-withdrawn`,
  `pointbreak.review-association-ref`, and `pointbreak.review-association-ref-withdrawn` JSON with the new
  association id and write counts.

Divergent or dangling associations surface as advisory diagnostics on the read surfaces
(`divergent_commit_association` when two or more distinct current commit OIDs claim one revision;
`retraction_target_missing` when a withdrawal names an association that never appeared); they are
render-only and never gate a write.

## `pointbreak history`

```bash
pointbreak history [--repo <path>] [--revision <id>] [--track <track-id>] \
  [--event-type <event-type>]... [--ref <name> [--by label|liveness]] \
  [--filter <query>] [--limit <n>] [--cursor <cursor>] [--watch [--poll-ms <ms>]] \
  [--include-body] [--format <fmt>]
```

`pointbreak history` reads the chronological ledger of durable Pointbreak events.

- History replays the resolved store's `events/` and emits compact `pointbreak.review-history` v1 JSON by
  default.
- `eventSetHash` and `eventCount` describe the full validated event set used to build the output,
  even when filters return only a subset of entries.
- `historyCount` is the number of returned entries after filters.
- Entries are sorted by `occurredAt`, then `eventId`, as display chronology.
- `--revision`, `--track`, and repeated `--event-type` narrow the returned entries.
- `--ref <name>` filters to events of revisions associated with a ref (a short branch name is
  normalized to its full ref). `--by` chooses how `--ref` matches: `label` (the recorded label,
  offline; the default) or `liveness` (reachability from the ref's live tip).
- `--filter <query>` runs the review filter grammar over the same per-event search records the
  inspector's timeline queries. Event-surface qualifiers: `type:` (label or wire id; a comma list
  ORs values, e.g. `type:observation,assessment`), `track:`, `actor:` (the `actor:` id prefix is
  optional), `revision:`, `snapshot:`, `check:` (`passed|failed|errored|skipped`), `assessment:`,
  `is:` (`open|answered`), `tag:` (a full tag string or its first-colon key — `tag:issue:191` or
  `tag:issue`), and `before:`/`after:` (ISO-8601 date/datetime prefixes). Bare terms match free
  text — including body content even without `--include-body` — and a leading `-` negates a
  clause. The filter applies before `--limit`/`--cursor` windowing and composes with all the typed
  flags above. A known-but-unsupported qualifier or value (for example `attention:` here) exits
  non-zero with the diagnostic; the deprecated `status:` alias for `check:` still runs behind a
  stderr hint.
- `--limit <n>` returns at most N entries as a forward page (from the start, or from `--cursor`); the
  response carries a `nextCursor` to continue. `--cursor <cursor>` continues from a previous
  response's opaque `nextCursor`. Omit both for the full history.
- `--watch` re-renders whenever the store's liveness changes, polling client-side at `--poll-ms`
  (default 3000). It is pull-only — no daemon and no filesystem watch — and is cancelled with
  Ctrl-C; under `--watch` the same `--limit` page is re-rendered on each liveness change.
- Succession and commit/ref association filters include `revision-captured`,
  `revision-commit-associated`, `revision-commit-withdrawn`, `revision-ref-associated`, and
  `revision-ref-withdrawn`.
- Body-like text is omitted by default. `--include-body` hydrates observation bodies, input request
  bodies, input request response reasons, assessment summaries, validation summaries, and
  imported-note bodies. Native Markdown/plain content-type fields are included for those body-like
  event fields when they are not plain text.
- Duplicate semantic events remain visible as separate entries while shared duplicate diagnostics
  are included in the document.

### Verification status and endorsement readback

`pointbreak history`, `pointbreak revision show`, and the inspector endpoints render two
reader-relative, **advisory** facts beside each event. They render only — they never gate a write or
change an exit code, and the temporal `require-verified-endorsement` tier is out of scope.

- `verificationStatus` ∈ `valid | invalid | untrusted_key | unsigned` — the per-event signature
  ladder, resolved against the **reader's** `.pointbreak/allowed-signers.json`. An event signed by a key
  the reader has not enrolled reads `untrusted_key`; an event with no signature reads `unsigned`.
- `endorsements[]` — for an endorsed (co-signed) target event, one entry per endorsement
  attestation (co-signature member). Because signatures are deterministic, one signer yields one
  attestation per target, so this is normally one entry per endorsing signer; an actor who endorses
  the same target with more than one enrolled key surfaces one entry per key (each is a distinct
  attestation, not collapsed):
  - `classification` ∈ `endorsement-trusted | unknown_endorser | ambiguous_endorser`.
  - `endorser` — the resolved actor, present only when `endorsement-trusted`.
  - `endorserAttributes` — the endorser's attested `kind`/`roles` from
    `.pointbreak/actor-attributes.json`. This is a **sibling enrichment** rendered beside the
    classification; it is **not** an input to how the classification is decided.

Both are **reader-relative**: the same endorsement carrier may read `endorsement-trusted` for a
reader who has enrolled the endorser and `unknown_endorser` for a reader who has not. A field is
omitted when empty — no verification policy configured, no endorsement on the target, or no attested
attributes for the endorser. The classification rules are decided in
[ADR-0013](./adr/adr-0013-endorsement-record-and-classification.md).

```json
{
  "eventId": "evt:sha256:…",
  "eventType": "work_object_proposed",
  "verificationStatus": "unsigned",
  "endorsements": [
    {
      "classification": "endorsement-trusted",
      "endorser": "actor:git-email:kevin@swiber.dev",
      "endorserAttributes": { "kind": "human", "roles": ["reviewer"] }
    },
    { "classification": "unknown_endorser" }
  ]
}
```

History is not the full revision row projection. Use `pointbreak revision show` for the composite
narrative-first plus snapshot-complete view of one captured revision.

## `pointbreak revision list`

```bash
pointbreak revision list [--repo <path>] [--object <object-id>] [--ref <name> [--by label|liveness]] \
  [--filter <query>] [--integration-ref <name>] [--worktree <path>] [--all | --unreachable] [--format <fmt>]
```

`pointbreak revision list` is the discovery surface for captured revisions. It emits
`pointbreak.review-revision-list` JSON with `eventSetHash`, `eventCount`, `revisionCount`, and entries
sorted by capture time. Each entry carries the revision id, the content-only object id, the capture
endpoints, and `objectArtifactContentHash`.

- `--object <object-id>` lists only the revisions that share one content object. Coincident content
  may span supersession threads, so this is a listing/grouping lens, never a head selector.
- `--ref <name>` filters to revisions associated with a ref (a short branch name is normalized to
  its full ref). `--by` chooses how `--ref` matches: `label` (the recorded label, offline; the
  default) or `liveness` (reachability from the ref's live tip). The succession view (the
  supersession DAG and a thread's competing heads) is reported by this same projection; there is no
  separate lineage surface.
- `--filter <query>` runs the same review filter grammar on the revision surface, over per-revision
  records aggregated from each revision's review facts. Revision-surface qualifiers: `track:` and
  `actor:` (the union across the revision's facts; the `actor:` id prefix is optional),
  `revision:`, `snapshot:`, `assessment:` (the resolved current assessment), `is:`
  (`open|answered|unassessed|stale|follow-up|contested|superseded`), `tag:` (full string or
  first-colon key), `attention:` (`open-request|unassessed|validation-context|follow-up|stale-fact`),
  and `before:`/`after:` (ISO-8601 prefixes over the capture time); bare terms match the revision's
  human text, and a leading `-` negates a clause. Only a filtered listing builds the per-revision
  overviews and supersession classification — a plain listing pays no new cost — and a grouped row
  filters on its representative revision. A known-but-unsupported qualifier (`type:`/`check:` on
  this surface) exits non-zero with the diagnostic; the deprecated `status:` alias for
  `assessment:` still runs behind a stderr hint.
- `--integration-ref <name>` sets the reachability target for the `merged` status: a revision is
  `merged` only when it is an ancestor of this ref (equality counts). It defaults to the repository's
  detected default branch (`origin/HEAD`, else local `main`/`master`) — the same narrow default
  `pointbreak revision show` applies — so the status answers "did this land on the default branch?". When
  no default branch is detected it falls back to broad reachability (any live tip).
- `--worktree <path>` scopes the listing to captures belonging to the worktree at that path.
- Every recorded revision is shown by default, including revisions whose anchored commits are all
  unreachable. `--all` remains an accepted compatibility spelling of that default; `--unreachable`
  explicitly narrows the listing to only those unreachable revisions (`--orphans` is a deprecated
  alias).
- Each entry carries `mergeStatus`: `merged` (an ancestor of the integration target), `open` (still
  reachable from a live ref without having landed there), `unreachable` (no live ref reaches any
  anchored commit — present-but-unreachable and gc'd objects alike; per-commit detail stays on
  `revision show`), or `unknown` (floating capture, divergent landing claims, or an unavailable
  repository). The former `orphaned` status is retired.

## `pointbreak revision show`

```bash
pointbreak revision show [REVISION] [--repo <path>] [--track <track-id>] \
  [--include-body] [--format <fmt>]
```

`pointbreak revision show` is the composite view for one revision. It emits compact
`pointbreak.review-revision` v2 JSON by default.

- When exactly one revision has been captured, Pointbreak selects it automatically.
- If multiple revisions exist, pass the `[REVISION]` positional. It is a **head seed**: a current
  head resolves exactly; a superseded revision resolves its thread's current head; and a thread with
  competing heads is reported as competing rather than auto-picked.
- The output includes revision identity, event-set freshness metadata, filters, summary counts,
  current assessment status, native observations, input requests, assessments, validation checks,
  projection rows, and diagnostics.
- Rows are narrative-first, then snapshot-complete.
- `commitRange.liveness` is the read-time Git enrichment (best-effort; omitted when the repository
  cannot be read). `perCommit[].condition` is `merged`, `live`, `unreachable` (object present, no
  live ref reaches it), or `missing` (object gone) — availability and reachability stay
  distinguishable, and nothing is called `orphaned`. An `unreachable` commit also carries
  `retention`: `reflog` while a reflog entry still retains the object, `none` after expiry.
  `refContinuity` diagnoses each recorded ref association: `current`, `advanced`, `rewritten`
  (best-effort reflog evidence naming the `rewriteAction`, e.g. `commit (amend)`, plus `sameTree`
  when both objects survive), `moved` (no rewrite evidence — expired reflog or a reset), `deleted`,
  or `unknown`. A `rewritten` ref adds a `ref_rewritten` diagnostic naming the recorded and current
  OIDs with the suggested explicit follow-up; reflog evidence never mutates the durable record.
- `--track <track-id>` filters narrative facts without changing the selected revision,
  event-set freshness metadata, or captured snapshot completeness.
- Body-like text is omitted by default. `--include-body` hydrates observation bodies, input request
  bodies and response reasons, assessment summaries, validation summaries, and imported-note bodies.
  Native Markdown/plain content-type fields are included for those body-like event fields when they
  are not plain text.
- Each narrative member (observations, input requests and their responses, assessments, validation
  checks) and the `revision` identity (the capture event) carry the same reader-relative
  `verificationStatus` and `endorsements` (with `endorserAttributes`) readback documented under
  [`pointbreak history`](#verification-status-and-endorsement-readback) — advisory, render-only,
  resolved against the reader's `.pointbreak/` trust and attributes config.

Revision-scoped selection seeds on the `[REVISION]` positional and resolves that revision's thread
head; no implicit newest capture globally wins. Unscoped current selection with multiple unrelated captured
revisions still errors at the selection boundary, but routine list, history, and exact-revision reads
have no always-on ambiguous-current warning. A thread-level read may surface
`stale_by_superseding_revision` for a revision that a newer revision supersedes. This release has no
interdiff or stack DAG beyond the supersession graph.

Capture and succession facts stay signable under ADR-0004's generic `EventToBeSigned` contract with
the Dead Simple Signing Envelope (DSSE) and pre-authentication encoding rules.

`pointbreak revision show` is distinct from `pointbreak history`: history is the chronological raw
event listing, while `pointbreak revision show` is the composite revision view for agents and future
frontends.
