# ADR-0020: Pluggable Durable-Storage Backend Seam (Journal + ContentStore)

**Status:** Accepted (owner-approved 2026-06-23); landed via the durable-storage backend-seam
implementation work. **Grounding re-verified against current `main` (`43bb8c6`):** no decision changed —
the compact re-hash-before-unlink floor and the strict/lenient skip-and-diagnose read surface independently
*reinforce* D2/D3 and the byte-not-typed design (see the notes in D3, D4, D11); a few `file:line` citations
were refreshed for the shifted `event_store.rs`/`state.rs`.
**Date:** 2026-06-23
**See also:** the durable-storage backend analysis that produced this decision. Relates to: **ADR-0004**
(event signatures — the layout-independence this relies on and preserves), **ADR-0015** (single common-dir
store — the `resolve_store` choke point
this threads a backend handle through), **ADR-0016** (content-targeted removal — only the
`ContentStore` removes; the `Journal` is append-only), **ADR-0017/ADR-0018** (object identity layering,
event-borne supersession — the content-address layer this sits beneath, untouched). Composes with
the `contentEncoding` direction (`contentEncoding` sits *below* the identity layer; see O3, composes without
re-keying the store).

## Context

Shoreline persists an event-sourced store as **plain JSON files**: one file per event under `events/`
(named `sha256(idempotencyKey).json`), one file per content object under `artifacts/objects/`,
externalized note bodies under `artifacts/notes/`, and a regenerable `state.json` projection. There are
**no storage traits today** — `EventStore` (`src/session/store/event_store.rs`) and `LocalStorage`
(`src/storage/mod.rs`) are concrete structs constructed **per-operation** from a `store_dir: &Path`,
which four `resolve_*` wrappers (`src/session/store/resolution.rs`) hand to ~25 production consumers,
each following the same shape (`resolve_* → EventStore::open / LocalStorage::new → build event →
record_event_once → SessionState::from_events → write state.json`). `LocalStorage` holds *most* of the
`fs::*` code, but it is **not** the only filesystem user: the object/body **read** paths bypass it with
direct `std::fs::read` (`object_artifact.rs:116`/`:141`/`:149`, `body_artifact.rs:87`) — a coupling the
`ContentStore` wrapper must absorb (a `ContentStore::get`), and one reason the content-store surface is
larger than "swap `LocalStorage`."

The owner wants the flexibility to **swap persistence backends and experiment with new on-disk data
structures, with clear, measured trade-offs** — and to run in-process unit tests against an in-memory
store. The durable-storage backend analysis established the forces:

- **Diffability is an architectural constraint, not a preference.** The durable truth layer stays
  plain-text and `git diff`-able; binary/analytical stores are allowed *only* in the derived,
  regenerable projection layer (out of scope here, D11). "Too many files" is answered by a *diffable*
  NDJSON log, never a binary truth store.
- **Signatures and content-hashes are layout-independent (verified against code).** Every digest
  (signatures, `eventRecordHash`, `payloadHash`, object `content_hash`, note-body hash) is computed from
  typed in-memory fields via `canonical_json`, **never from storage bytes**; read-time re-derivation
  rejects on mismatch (`validate_event`, `verify_event_signature`, `decode_and_validate_object_artifact`),
  so a lossless serde round-trip validates under any backend.
- **"Too many files" is two distinct problems (measured on APFS/SSD).** A *many-small-files* event
  problem (1.93× disk amplification over a 4 KB block floor; **63× slower read-all** at 10 k events:
  144.8 ms file-per-event vs 2.3 ms NDJSON) and a *few-large-files* object problem (1.02× amplification,
  max object 128 KB) — wanting **different** fixes (a diffable NDJSON log vs. transparent compression).
- **The refactor is small in production, test-dominated overall.** ~25 production consumers thread the
  handle; the larger counts (`EventStore::open` ~149×, `LocalStorage::new` ~30–40×) are test call sites
  — why static generics are the wrong dispatch (D6) and the in-memory test-rewrite is its own stage (D10).

This ADR records the **durable-layer** abstraction only; the projection/read-model cache is a
named-but-deferred third seam (D11).

## Decision

### D1. Two byte-oriented traits over opaque bytes

Introduce two **object-safe, byte-oriented** traits (`&[u8]` in/out, not typed
`ShoreEvent`/`ObjectArtifact` operations) below the storage seam. Method names below are the recommended
canonical form for the landing; the substance is what binds.

```rust
enum CreateOutcome { Created, AlreadyExists }   // promoted from CreateFileOutcome (drop the "File"-ism)
enum RemoveOutcome { Removed, Missing }

/// Idempotency-keyed append-with-dedup over OPAQUE event bytes. APPEND-ONLY (no remove).
trait Journal {
    /// Atomic, lock-free, CROSS-PROCESS-SAFE create-if-absent keyed by the logical
    /// idempotency key (the backend maps it to its own address: the file impl hashes
    /// it to a filename; an in-memory impl keys a map on the raw key). See D3.
    fn create_event_once(&self, idempotency_key: &str, bytes: &[u8]) -> Result<CreateOutcome>;
    fn read_event_bytes(&self, idempotency_key: &str) -> Result<Option<Vec<u8>>>;
    fn event_exists(&self, idempotency_key: &str) -> Result<bool>;   // absorbs today's raw Path::exists() leak
    fn list_event_bytes(&self) -> Result<Vec<Vec<u8>>>;              // full-iteration read surface; DETERMINISTIC order (D4)
}

/// Content-addressed CAS over OPAQUE blobs, shared by objects AND note bodies. Supports remove.
trait ContentStore {
    fn put_once(&self, content_ref: &str, bytes: &[u8]) -> Result<CreateOutcome>;
    fn get(&self, content_ref: &str) -> Result<Vec<u8>>;            // absorbs today's direct std::fs::read of object/body artifacts
    fn get_if_exists(&self, content_ref: &str) -> Result<Option<Vec<u8>>>;
    fn remove(&self, content_ref: &str) -> Result<RemoveOutcome>;   // dumb unlink; ADR-0016 gc/compact (the compact re-hash floor is wrapper-level — D3)
    fn list(&self, prefix: &str) -> Result<Vec<String>>;            // store-relative refs, deterministic order (path-shaped — see Open Questions)
}
```

### D2. One backend-agnostic wrapper owns the crypto-sensitive decisions; backends are dumb byte sinks

The idempotency / co-signature classification (`Created` / `Existing` / `ExistingDivergentSignature` /
conflict, today `record_event_once`, `event_store.rs:32-86`) **and** content-hash validation live in
**exactly one** backend-agnostic wrapper above the traits. A backend implements only the byte primitives
in D1 and inherits the crypto-sensitive logic unchanged. The wrapper boundary already exists —
`record_event_once` makes the entire decision above the single `create_file_exclusive` call; the
refactor consolidates the content-hash half (today split across `write_object_artifact_to` /
`decode_and_validate_object_artifact` / `validate_note_body_artifact_bytes`) into the `ContentStore`
wrapper. The backend reports only `CreateOutcome::{Created, AlreadyExists}` (D1); on `AlreadyExists` the
wrapper reads the stored bytes back and maps to today's richer `EventWriteOutcome`
(`Existing` / `ExistingDivergentSignature` / conflict) by the typed `payload_hash` / `event_record_hash`
comparison — the classification is the wrapper's, never the backend's. **Byte-not-typed is decisive**: a
typed surface would tempt a backend to re-canonicalize or
re-serialize on read and silently shift the bytes a content-hash validates over — the frozen-content-id class
of silent signed-store break — and a dumb-byte-sink backend makes that class of
break *structurally impossible to introduce by adding a backend*.

### D3. Backend invariance obligations O1–O4 + the cross-process atomicity clause

A backend swap must break no signature and no content-hash. The verified obligations the wrapper/traits
enforce:

- **O1 — Events may re-serialize** in any byte layout *iff* the `ShoreEvent` serde round-trip is lossless
  (canonical key-sort erases byte order at hash time). The one hazard is `payload: serde_json::Value` —
  the one place a backend could round-trip lossily (float/Unicode normalization) without a compile error.
  A regression test round-trips an edge-case payload and asserts `payloadHash` stability (pins O1).
- **O2 — Objects/note bodies need deterministic, byte-identical serialization** of identical typed
  content across stores/backends — a *determinism* obligation (for #146 cross-worktree dedup
  convergence), **not** "hash the file bytes."
- **O3 — The content address / dedup key is the decoded-content `sha256`,** never raw stored-byte
  equality. Content-hash *validation* already re-derives from decoded canonical content (objects hash
  `{schema, version, snapshot}` with `contentHash` removed and re-canonicalized,
  `object_artifact.rs:197-211`; note bodies hash only `NoteBodyEnvelope.body`, `body_artifact.rs:131-138`).
  **byte-exact `ContentStore` round-trip** (`get(put(b)) == b`) is a *separate* current dedup/storage
  obligation. Stating the address over decoded content is what lets `contentEncoding`
  (which makes *stored* bytes differ per store) compose with this seam **without re-keying the store**.
- **O4 — No digest reads event position.** Signatures, content-hashes, and the `event_set_hash`
  liveness token (which sorts before hashing, `freshness.rs:23-43`) are all order-free. **This does NOT
  mean the materialized `state.json` projection is order-free — see D4.**

The **cross-process atomic create-if-absent** clause (D1) is the hardest obligation and is stated as
**cross-process**, not merely "atomic": there is no store-dir lock by design (`resolution.rs:98-101`),
so multi-worktree write-through correctness rests on it (today `O_CREAT|O_EXCL`; measured as
8-racing → 1 `Created` / 7 `AlreadyExists`). A real alternative *diffable-truth* backend meets it its own
way — e.g. **NDJSON** via an advisory lock or single-writer broker (Open Questions). (A database
`UNIQUE`/`INSERT-OR-IGNORE` is the analogous mechanism, but a binary DB is **rejected for the truth
layer** under diffable-truth — see Rejected — and belongs only to the deferred projection layer, D11; it
is not a durable-truth backend example.) A backend correct only single-process is silently lossy in
production, not just slower; the in-memory backend's
single-process weakening is a deliberately-scoped non-production exception (D7), enforced by the selector
(D8) — never a relaxation of the production contract.

**Content-hash validation also guards the remove path (reinforced by the compact re-hash-before-unlink work
landed on main).**
`compact_store` (`artifact_removal/mod.rs:478`) now **re-verifies a blob's decoded-content hash before it
erases it** (refuse-on-drift → `SweepOutcome::HashMismatchSkipped`, `artifact_removal/mod.rs:439-446`),
and the module is explicit that "identity is over decoded content, not raw bytes" — an independent landing
that *confirms* O3 and D2. The trait split is unchanged: the re-hash-before-unlink is **wrapper logic**
(read decoded bytes via `ContentStore::get`, re-hash, decide) sitting **above** the dumb
`ContentStore::remove` primitive, whose outcome stays `RemoveOutcome { Removed, Missing }` (the
compact-level `SweepOutcome` that adds `HashMismatchSkipped` is the *wrapper's*, not the backend's). A
backend implements only the dumb remove; the content-hash floor rides along in the one wrapper.

### D4. Event listing order is deterministic; the `state.json` projection is order-sensitive

`SessionState::from_events` reduces events in the order the slice is supplied (`state.rs:67`), and at
least one reducer is **first-seen-wins**: `apply_input_request_opened` uses `.or_insert(assertion_mode)`
(`state.rs:225`). Today the file backend's `list_events` (`event_store.rs:129`) returns a **deterministic
hash-sorted** order (`sha256(idempotencyKey)` filenames; the sort is produced by `LocalStorage::list_dir`'s
`paths.sort()`, `storage/mod.rs:215`, surfaced through `list_event_file_names`, `event_store.rs:163`), so
`state.json` is byte-stable.
Therefore, although O4 makes *digests* order-free, the materialized projection is **not** order-free, and
the contract must protect it:

- `Journal::list_event_bytes` MUST return a **deterministic** order. The **default file backend preserves
  today's hash-sorted order**, so `state.json` is byte-identical across the refactor (the zero-format-change
  gate, D10).
- Any **alternative** backend whose listing order differs from the file backend's must be gated by an
  **order-audit** that verifies reducer **outcome** stability — *not merely byte-stability*. A different
  order can select a different first-seen *winner* (`apply_input_request_opened`'s `.or_insert(assertion_mode)`
  would store a *different* `assertion_mode`), a **semantically** different projection, not just different
  bytes. The audit must sweep **all** reducers, not only the one named here (this ADR cites
  `apply_input_request_opened` as a *confirmed* first-seen reducer, not a claim it is the only one).
  **Alternatively**, the wrapper/projection path imposes a canonical order (e.g. sort decoded events by a
  stable key) before reducing, which moots the audit. Either way this is a per-alternative-backend
  obligation, surfaced now so it is not discovered at the first non-file backend.

This refines the research's "order-independent" claim, which was specifically about the `event_set_hash`
liveness token (it sorts), not the full state reducer.

### D5. The projection write stays off the traits; durable writes are always durable

The derived `state.json` write is a **projection, not an event**: it stays a `Durability::Projection`
*filesystem* write on the `LocalStorage` primitive (today `ingest.rs:239-243`) and is **not** routed
through `Journal`. The trait surface never grows a "write a view" method. Consequently the durable traits
**drop the `Durability` parameter** (they are always `Durable`); `Durability::Projection` survives only on
the local-storage primitive the projection writer uses directly. This keeps the diffable truth layer from
absorbing the projection layer's (permitted) freedom to be binary/analytical (D11).

### D6. Dispatch: a closed `StoreBackend` enum at the single `resolve_store` choke point

Dispatch is **dynamic, via a closed `StoreBackend` enum**, introduced at the **single `resolve_store`
choke point** (`resolution.rs:144`) and nowhere else. Because stores are constructed per-open, dispatch
cost is performance-irrelevant; ergonomics decides. **Static generics are rejected** — runtime selection
needs a dynamic branch regardless, and generics would virally parameterize ~180 sites (mostly tests)
without buying the selection. The resolver returns a backend handle instead of a `PathBuf`; consumers
change **only at their construction line**. The traits are kept **object-safe** as cheap insurance even
though a closed enum needs no `dyn`.

### D7. Deliverable impls: default-file + in-memory only; in-memory is test/experiment-only

This work ships **two impls only**: the **default file** backend (today's layout, verbatim) and an
**in-memory** backend (`Mutex<HashMap>`) for in-process tests/experiments. The in-memory backend is the
**honesty test** for the seam — if any contract clause were file-shaped, it could not satisfy it. It
**drops** crash durability (`Durability` no-op) and cross-process visibility, and **keeps** the
**backend-level** clauses (atomic create-if-absent *within the process*, byte-exact round-trip,
`get`/`list`/`remove`). The wrapper-owned crypto logic — the co-signature decision and content-hash
validation (D2) — is **not** the backend's job; it rides along unchanged for *every* backend. The honesty
test is precisely that none of those wrapper clauses turned out to be file-shaped — the in-memory backend
carries them without a filesystem; its only gaps are the two deliberate drops above (crash durability,
cross-process visibility). Its cross-process drop is a deliberately-scoped non-production exception (D3),
enforced by the selector rule in D8.

### D8. Selector: `SHORE_BACKEND` env var for file-shaped backends; in-memory is in-process injection only

Runtime selection without a rebuild uses a **`SHORE_BACKEND` env var**, defaulting to `local`,
**hard-erroring on an unknown value** (borrowing `StoreMode`'s loud posture for the *value*, using the
`SHORE_PERF` env-var *mechanism* — a developer/experiment toggle, not an operative per-store property).
The `.shore/store.json` config-file mechanism is **held in reserve** for if/when a backend becomes a
durable per-store fact (a complete `store mode` template exists to promote it).

The implementable rule for the in-memory/subprocess distinction (the gap F3 named):

- **`SHORE_BACKEND` selects only persistent, file-shaped backends** (`local`; later `ndjson`). These
  cross the subprocess boundary cleanly via `Command::env` (the test harness already does this), so the
  CLI tier can exercise a file-shaped alternative end-to-end (the child re-reads the same on-disk store).
- **The in-memory backend is selected exclusively by in-process programmatic injection** (a test/experiment
  constructs the `StoreBackend::Memory` variant directly, or sets it via a process-local API) — it is
  **never an `SHORE_BACKEND` env value**, so a spawned `shore` child can never inherit it and start an
  empty, lost-on-exit store. (`SHORE_BACKEND=memory` is therefore *not a valid value* and hard-errors,
  consistent with the unknown-value rule.) This makes the distinction a structural property of *how* the
  backend is selected, not a runtime check.

### D9. What stays `LocalStorage`-only, beside/below the trait

Not everything is abstracted. These stay `LocalStorage`-typed by nature:

- The **`store_migrate.rs` flat→nested relocator** — intrinsic directory moves with no cross-backend
  meaning (permanently `LocalStorage`-only).
- The **`.git/info/exclude` + temp-sweep helpers** in `prepare_store_writer_at` — worktree-git concerns
  keyed on `worktree_root`, not store concerns.
- The **common-dir fold** (`store_migrate_common_dir.rs`, which rides `import_store_bundle`, *not*
  intrinsic dir moves) and the **`bundle.rs` / `inventory.rs` walks** stay `LocalStorage`-typed in stage 1;
  they are bundle/inventory **consumers**, abstractable later through a `ContentStore`/`Journal` read
  surface *only if* a non-file backend needs bundle/inventory support — a consumer refactor, not a file-ism.

The **inspector** and **`cli/store.rs`** are projection/repo-keyed and change nothing.

### D10. Zero-format-change: the existing suite is the regression net and the acceptance gate; staging

Introducing the traits with the file impl as default is a **behavior-preserving refactor**: no on-disk
layout change, no new event/schema/store version, **no `sigVersion` bump, no signed-store break**: every
format-bearing constant lives in the typed model *above* storage, and there is no store-version/manifest file
to move. The layout strings (`events`,
`artifacts/objects`, `artifacts/notes`, `state.json`) and the file backend's hash-sorted listing order
(D4) are preserved verbatim, so `state.json` is byte-identical. Consequently the **existing capture /
idempotency / co-signature / gc-compact / inventory / migrate / bundle / resolver / freshness suites pin
observable behavior without asserting the trait shape** — keeping them **green and unchanged is the
acceptance gate**. Stage the work:

1. **Pure default-file refactor** — introduce the traits + the file impl + the wrapper; thread the handle
   through the `resolve_store` seam. The entire existing suite **green and unchanged** is the gate. Keep
   the D9 `LocalStorage`-only items as-is.
2. **In-memory impl** + the bounded **~16-site test-rewrite** (tamper writes + `read_dir` count assertions
   move to a `put_raw`/`insert_raw` backend hook; ~14 layout-seeding `create_dir_all` + 12 `state.json`
   reads stay on `LocalStorage` as the regression net; the 25 `tests/` integration `fs::*` calls are
   permanently subprocess-bound).
3. **Benchmark harness** for the NDJSON candidate (boardwalk fixture + synthetic changesets). Any *real*
   alternative backend's on-disk format is a later, **separately-gated** decision under
   `docs/store-migration.md` §8's convergence rule — never bundled into this trait landing.

### D11. Explicit deferral of the `ProjectionStore` seam (the three-layer model)

The architecture names **three layers**: **journal** (events), **content** (objects + note bodies), and
**projection** (materialized read views — `state.json` + `SessionState::from_events`, plus the on-the-fly
history/show/revisions/inspect reductions). This ADR abstracts the first two. The **projection layer is a
named-but-deferred seam** and is *not* symmetric with the durable traits: `Journal`/`ContentStore`
abstract dumb byte persistence (meaning lives above), while a future `ProjectionStore` would abstract
**query semantics** (the whole point of a DuckDB-style analytical projection is SQL/columnar pushdown,
not where bytes land). Today there is exactly one materialized view (`state.json`), no persistent
secondary index, and no measured query pain, so designing it now is premature.

The read surface keeps it open: full iteration (`list_event_bytes`, D4) plus the pure, order-independent
`event_set_hash` (`freshness.rs:23-43`). Note the read surface now has **strict** (`list_events`,
`event_store.rs:129`) **and lenient** (`list_events_lenient`, `event_store.rs:140`, feeding
`read_events_for_display`, `read.rs:170`) decode variants — the skip-and-diagnose path for
schema-broken events. Both decode the *same* `Journal::list_event_bytes`; the strict-vs-lenient policy is
**wrapper/projection-level, not a `Journal` concern**, which confirms byte-not-typed (D2) — the byte trait
needs no lenient variant. An incremental projector's "events since H" / stable cursor is a
**future additive** `Journal` method, not a redesign, and likely wants a real append-log backend. A
DuckDB-shaped analytical projection is its **own** future research → ADR → plan, triggered by a concrete
slow read path or an analytical query the on-the-fly reducer serves poorly (cross-revision observations,
validation-over-time, supersession-DAG traversal). This is where the diffable-truth boundary is enforced:
the projection layer is *precisely* where a binary/analytical store is allowed, because it is derived and
rebuildable from the journal.

## Consequences

### Accepted

- **Backends become swappable for experiments behind one stable seam**, with the crypto invariants
  enforced once (D2) — adding a backend can never silently break a signature or content-hash (D3), the
  highest-stakes failure mode.
- **The refactor is a pure, zero-format-change rename of the seam** (D10): ~25 production consumers change
  only at their construction line; `state.json` stays byte-identical (D4); the existing suite, green and
  unchanged, is the gate.
- **A diffable answer to "too many files"** is named and measured (D7): NDJSON for events (built later),
  compression for objects — the truth layer stays plain-text and `git diff`-able throughout.
- **In-process unit tests gain an in-memory backend** (D7) — a real but **narrow** speed win (store-heavy
  `event_store.rs` modules; removes ~2 fsyncs + ~4 syscalls per event write); **invisible to the subprocess
  CLI tier**, not pitched as a whole-suite speedup.
- **Costs accepted:** a net `dyn`/enum indirection per store-open (negligible at per-command frequency); a
  bounded ~16-site test-rewrite (D10); a per-alternative-backend order-audit obligation (D4); and the
  cross-process atomicity clause (D3) as a real obligation every production backend must meet.

### Rejected

- **A typed trait surface** (`Journal::append(event)` / `ContentStore::put(artifact)`) — tempts a
  signature/content-hash-perturbing re-serialization on read; the whole point is a dumb byte sink (D2).
- **Static generics for dispatch** — cannot do runtime selection alone and would virally parameterize
  ~180 sites (D6).
- **A binary truth store** (sqlite/redb/sled, or packed binary segments — git packfiles, EventStoreDB
  chunks) — forfeits `git`-diffability; binary belongs only in the deferred projection layer (D11). Packed
  segments survive only as prior art proving NDJSON is the *diffable* way to pack.
- **FastCDC content-defined chunking now** — byte-stable only with deterministic reassembly+rehash (high
  blast radius vs O1–O3) and it destroys per-object diffability; no fixture shows the multi-MB pain it
  solves. Prefer `contentEncoding` compression if object size ever bites (D7).
- **The `.shore/store.json` config-file selector now** — a backend is an experiment toggle, not yet a
  durable per-store property; held in reserve (D8).
- **`SHORE_BACKEND=memory` as an env-reachable value** — it would let a spawned child inherit an empty,
  lost-on-exit store; in-memory is in-process injection only (D8).
- **Weakening cross-process create-if-absent to single-process** (D3) — the in-memory single-process
  weakening is a scoped non-production exception, not a relaxation of the production contract.
- **`remove` on the `Journal`** — the journal is append-only; ADR-0016 removal is content-targeted on the
  `ContentStore` only (D1).
- **Routing `state.json` through the `Journal`** — collapses the truth and projection layers (D5).

## Open Questions

- **NDJSON locking mechanism** — `flock` advisory lock vs an in-process single-writer broker vs a sidecar
  lockfile, against Shoreline's per-operation, no-long-lived-handle construction pattern. Any such lock
  **must be store-directory scoped, never one-clone-one-writer** (`resolution.rs:98-101` states this as a
  forward constraint). (Hand-off to the NDJSON backend plan.)
- **`ContentStore` path-shaped addressing** — `content_ref` and `list(prefix)` are store-relative
  *path-shaped* strings (`artifacts/objects`, `artifacts/notes`), a mild file-layout leak (inherited from
  today's layout) into the otherwise byte-pure trait. A non-file backend can emulate it (a `HashMap`
  prefix-filter, SQL `LIKE`), but a cleaner shape would have the **wrapper** own object-vs-note namespacing
  — an opaque content address + a `kind` discriminator — so the backend never models file prefixes. Decide
  at the first non-file `ContentStore` backend; the file impl is fine as-is.
- **The put/get decoded-vs-encoded boundary** — does `ContentStore::put`/`get`
  operate over decoded bytes (wrapper owns hashing/address; encoding is an internal backend concern) or
  already-encoded bytes? Likely "wrapper computes the decoded-content hash + address; backend stores opaque
  (possibly encoded) bytes under that address and returns decoded bytes." Confirm when `contentEncoding`
  lands (O3).
- **Order-audit vs wrapper-canonicalization (D4)** — for the first non-file backend, is the projection's
  order-sensitivity handled by auditing the few `or_insert`/first-seen reducers, or by sorting decoded
  events to a canonical order in the wrapper before reducing? Decide when an out-of-hash-order backend is
  actually built; the file impl needs neither.
- **Tamper-hook trait shape** — a `#[cfg(test)]`-gated trait method vs a separate `TamperJournal` test
  trait vs a free function. Decide in the implementation work (D10).
- **`store status` reporting the effective backend** — `SHORE_BACKEND` is env-only (no committed source to
  report), but surfacing the *effective* backend aids experiment hygiene. Cheap; defer to the implementation
  work.
- **Cross-store format mismatch under env selection** — a store written by `local` and re-read under
  `ndjson` mismatches on-disk format; the experiment surface needs a documented rule (a distinct on-disk
  subtree per backend, or developer-owned consistency).
- **Append-latency on slow/networked storage** — all append measurements are APFS/SSD, where the two layouts
  are within fsync noise; the file-per-event double fsync could widen on a slow/networked FS. Direction
  unchanged; magnitude unmeasured.

## Revisit Triggers

- A measured read-all or write-amplification pain on a real store crosses a threshold worth NDJSON's
  concurrency cost → build the NDJSON backend as its own implementation effort.
- `contentEncoding` lands and makes *stored* bytes differ per store → confirm the dedup key
  has moved to the decoded-content `sha256` (O3) and the put/get encoded boundary is settled.
- A backend stops being an experiment and becomes a durable per-store fact → promote the selector from the
  `SHORE_BACKEND` env var to the `.shore/store.json` config-file mechanism (D8).
- A concrete slow read path, or an analytical query the on-the-fly reducer serves poorly, emerges → open
  the deferred `ProjectionStore` seam as its own ADR and implementation effort (D11), DuckDB the lead candidate.
- A non-file backend with a different listing order is proposed → resolve the D4 order-audit-vs-canonicalize
  question before it lands.
- Any proposal to add a typed method, a `remove` on the `Journal`, or a binary truth store → reopen here;
  these are the load-bearing rejections (D1, D2, Rejected).

## Amendment: Logical Transfer Is Frozen; No Physical Profile Is Selected (2026-07-19)

ADR-0020's byte-oriented Journal/ContentStore seam, wrapper-owned identity/conflict policy, append-only
journal, deterministic replay, independent content lifecycle, and derived projection layer stand. The
feature-gated SQLite WAL and bounded-segment implementations under `src/bench_support/foundation/` are
qualification artifacts, not production backends or a runtime selector.

Repeated native qualification failed the required performance gate for both candidates on both workloads.
Accordingly, this amendment does **not** reverse the current production physical layout, select binary truth
storage, freeze a physical profile or limit, remove the loose reader/writer, expose a migration command, or
authorize a live-root cutover. The original binary-store rejection remains the production decision until a
future ADR selects a candidate that passes every hard gate.

[ADR-0039](./adr-0039-exact-logical-bundles-and-import-receipts.md) independently freezes exact decoded-byte
transfer, backend-neutral key/hash reconciliation, a separate durable operational import receipt, and the
distinction between logical replication, candidate-native backup, and immutable archive copy. Any future
physical profile must preserve these seams, use one compiled strict profile rather than a user-facing
selector, keep writable live roots on eligible local filesystems, and provide exhaustive inventory,
candidate-native backup/restore, copy-out repair, and explicit platform consequences.

## Amendment: Physical Diffability Is Not a Storage Constraint (2026-07-20)

The implemented byte-oriented `Journal` and `ContentStore` seam, wrapper-owned identity and conflict policy,
append-only event meaning, deterministic replay, independently removable content, durable acknowledgement,
recovery, backup/repair, and derived-projection boundary stand. The current traits still operate on opaque
bytes and locators while wrappers own validation and ordering (`src/session/store/backend/mod.rs:84-155`;
`src/session/store/event_store.rs:85-285`). ADR-0039 independently keeps logical transfer free of physical
coordinates and requires candidate-native inventory, backup, restore, and repair
(`docs/adr/adr-0039-exact-logical-bundles-and-import-receipts.md:20-130`). The requirement that durable
physical truth remain plain text or directly inspectable with `git diff` does not.

### Decision

Pointbreak does **not** require a production storage profile to expose raw physical files as human-readable
or diffable text. A candidate may use text, binary framing, compression, immutable tables, or an
embedded engine's opaque physical representation. Physical opacity alone is neither a rejection reason nor
a policy exception requiring separate authorization.

This decision supersedes the original statements that diffability is an architectural constraint, that
binary storage belongs only in derived projections, and that a packed or database-owned truth store is
ineligible because it forfeits `git` diffability. It also supersedes the 2026-07-19 amendment's sentence
leaving the original binary-store rejection in force. That amendment's no-selection and no-activation
boundary otherwise stands: the current loose profile remains production truth until a later approved
decision selects and lands a replacement that satisfies every applicable semantic, safety, platform,
qualification, migration, and operational gate.

Dropping physical diffability does not create a compensating requirement for a derived diffable mirror.
Exact decoded identity, deterministic logical replay and export, exhaustive inventory, integrity status,
coherent backup/restore, copy-out repair, and independently provable content removal remain requirements
because each has its own semantic or operational value—not because they imitate raw file diffs. A projection,
export, or diagnostic view must not become a second source of truth.

Candidate admission therefore evaluates observable meaning and operation rather than carrier legibility.
Process topology, one strict physical profile, native filesystem behavior, durability and recovery, privacy,
and measured replacement value remain independent decisions and gates. Pure-Rust dependencies remain a
preference whose concrete build, distribution, provenance, update, FFI, and support consequences must be
compared for each candidate; they are not a separate truth-store eligibility gate. Removing the diffability
constraint does not waive any retained requirement and does not select a binary backend.

### Consequences

#### Accepted

- Opaque or binary candidates can be screened and prototyped without a special diffability exception.
- Storage design can optimize allocation, write amplification, keyed reads, recovery, and maintenance without
  preserving a text layout that has no current product value.
- The durable public contracts stay at the logical and operational seams where Pointbreak already validates
  identity, replay, transfer, inventory, backup, repair, and content lifecycle.
- The current loose layout remains a qualified baseline and production truth, but not because its files are
  directly diffable.

#### Rejected

- Retaining raw physical diffability as a candidate-admission or production-selection gate.
- Requiring an opaque profile to emit and maintain a canonical diffable shadow copy; that would duplicate
  authority and storage without restoring a valued workflow.
- Treating exact logical export as a semantic substitute for physical diffability. It remains required on
  its own terms, while physical diffability is simply not promised.
- Using physical opacity to weaken strict decoding, identity validation, complete carrier inventory,
  corruption reporting, backup/restore, repair, erasure proof, or native-platform evidence.
- Reading this amendment as selection, migration authorization, runtime backend choice, or production
  activation for any candidate.

### Revisit triggers

Revisit only if a concrete user or operator workflow demonstrates that raw physical text comparison is
itself necessary in addition to the retained logical, inventory, integrity, backup, and repair contracts.
Preference for readable files, debugging convenience, or a candidate's implementation shape is not
sufficient by itself to restore a production constraint.

## Amendment: Derived Access Adds a Cursor beside Loose Truth (2026-08-02)

ADR-0020's byte-oriented `Journal` and `ContentStore`, wrapper-owned identity and conflict policy,
append-only journal meaning, independently removable content, deterministic strict replay, and
truth/projection separation stand. The 2026-07-20 amendment also stands: physical diffability is not a
storage constraint.

This amendment supersedes only D11's prediction that a stable incremental cursor likely requires replacing
the loose journal and its implication that the future projection layer is primarily analytical. Pointbreak
now has an as-built incremental derived-access layer beside unchanged loose authoritative carriers. The
`Journal` exposes a bounded local change observable, while a separate private ledger supplies
`TruthCursor { epoch, sequence }`, receipts, and bounded successor reads
(`src/session/store/backend/mod.rs:294-367`; `src/session/derived_access/cursor.rs:8-68`). The cursor is an
operational position, not an event identity, signature input, display key, replay key, bundle coordinate, or
public API value.

The derived path also introduces a store-directory-scoped writer lock
(`src/session/store/resolution.rs:264-267`; `src/session/derived_access/sqlite/writer_lock.rs:17-58`). This
does not change loose `create_once` semantics: direct loose writers retain the lock-free, cross-process
create-once contract. The lock serializes governed derived-access admission, receipt finalization, and
derived generation lifecycle transitions; it never gates direct loose writes.

Loose `Journal` and `ContentStore` bytes remain the sole authority for event and content identity,
create-once classification, selected reread, validation, strict replay, transfer, backup, repair, and
removal. Cursor, locator, semantic, and checkpoint state is private, bodyless, disposable, and rebuildable.
Its loss never loses truth; its corruption or incompatibility fails closed to quarantine or rebuild.

Append order, display order, and canonical replay order are intentionally distinct. `TruthCursor` orders
admission and catch-up; normalized `(occurredAt, eventId)` orders chronological display; the existing
deterministic replay key orders semantic reconstruction. A backdated or canonical-earlier event advances the
append cursor without becoming the newest display or replay item.

SQLite-WAL is selected for this private derived layer, not for the durable truth traits. No SQLite row id,
page, WAL frame, path, or SQL expression enters event/content identity, logical transfer, or a public domain
document. A public `ProjectionStore` trait remains deferred until a second implementation earns the seam.
The complete as-built decision is [ADR-0041](./adr-0041-bodyless-sqlite-derived-access.md).

These mechanics apply only when the selected `sqlite-wal-bodyless-v1` profile is active. The checked-in
runtime default remains `off`; this amendment authorizes no rollout, truth migration, production activation,
or release promise.

## Amendment: Default-On Derived-Access Rollout (2026-08-03)

The preceding default-off sentence is the historical source-cut boundary for the 2026-08-02 amendment. The
as-built runtime now selects `sqlite-wal-bodyless-v1` when `POINTBREAK_DERIVED_ACCESS` is unset. Explicit
`POINTBREAK_DERIVED_ACCESS=off` remains the immediate artifact-free rollback.

This does not alter the durable storage seam: loose `Journal` and `ContentStore` carriers remain the sole
authority, direct loose create-once remains lock-free, and cursor/locator/semantic state remains private,
bodyless, disposable, and reconstructible. A missing, incompatible, corrupt, busy, or transitioning derived
generation cannot make a valid loose read or write unavailable. First bounded reads fall back to truth with
one actionable hint; first writes publish truth once and report derived degradation rather than rebuilding
history synchronously.

The store-level `derived/` container follows the exact resolved authoritative store root. A compatible
legacy `.pointbreak-derived*` namespace transitions without replay only when its generation, writer/rebuild
locks, and reader leases permit an exclusive move; conflicts are reported rather than guessed, merged, or
deleted. Operators diagnose or repair disposable state with
`pointbreak store derived status|build|rebuild`. No authoritative truth migration, backend replacement, or
logical-transfer change is part of this rollout.
