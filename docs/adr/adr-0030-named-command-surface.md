# ADR-0030: Named Command Surface — `shore diff` Defined, the `show` Collision Resolved, `up`/`session`/`dump` Settled

**Status:** Accepted (owner-approved 2026-07-02); landed 2026-07-02 (grounding issue #96).
**Date:** 2026-07-02
**See also:** **ADR-0029** (CLI output-mode convention — the human-default/`--format` split this
surface rides), **ADR-0018**
(event-borne supersession — the reshape that made the captured revision the product's subject),
the "Old dump/show stream vs. revision ledger" section of `docs/review-workflow.md` (the two-surface
seam this ADR resolves), and `docs/cli-reference.md` §`shore show`/`shore dump`. Grounding issue:
**#96** (human-readable readback — `shore diff` and the digest layer are its deliverable).

## Context

Shoreline's early product vocabulary named a six-command human surface — `shore diff`, `shore
show`, `shore up`, `shore notes`, `shore session`, `shore dump` — but the surface was never
defined, and the ground has moved under it. The README was repositioned around the durable review
record (`57ace44`) and now names none of `diff`/`show`/`up`/`session`/`dump`; onboarding
(`docs/getting-started.md`) runs through `shore review capture`, `shore review show --pretty`, and
`shore inspect`. Meanwhile the revision ledger shipped: capture, observations, input requests,
assessments, validation, and associations are live, and the captured revision — not the working
tree — is what the product is about.

Two of the six names exist today, and they are one legacy surface with two front-ends: `shore
dump` and `shore show` both build a `DumpDocument` from the **live working-tree diff at run time**
plus imported `review-notes.json` sidecar notes (`src/cli/input.rs:17-28`, `src/dump.rs`), and
neither reads the revision ledger at all. The TUI's row vocabulary (`src/tui/view.rs:7-17`) has no
revision, observation, input-request, assessment, or validation row kind — it is a diff+notes
viewer for the pre-revision workflow. `shore.dump` JSON has **zero found consumers** despite being
documented as an integration surface.

This produces the collision any human-readback direction hits first: **two `show` commands** —
top-level `shore show` (TUI, live tree) and `shore review show` (machine composite, frozen
revision) — same verb, opposite subjects. And it leaves the #96 job unserved: the immutable
captured diff, the actual object under review, has no terminal reader. `shore review show`
interleaves the diff into a 1.94 MB machine document; the TUI renders the wrong subject; the
inspector reads the captured snapshot well but requires a browser.

What the terminal must *not* do is rebuild the inspector: the supersession DAG, the filterable
event timeline, the per-line-annotated cross-file diff, and the endorsement web are relational,
visual, and already served (`src/cli/inspect/`). The terminal owes the human the loop-inline
readbacks — bounded digests (ADR-0029's human lane) and the captured diff itself.

## Decision

### 1. Bare top-level verbs read against the product's subject: the captured review record

A top-level `shore <verb>` must be about the captured review record — the thing shore holds that
nothing else does. Any command about another subject (the live working tree, sidecar notes, keys,
the store) is family-scoped under a noun (`shore notes …`, `shore store …`), where verbs may
repeat without ambiguity (`shore review show` vs `shore notes show` name different subjects;
top-level bare `show` names none). This principle decides every case below.

### 2. `shore diff` — captured-revision human diff readback (the #96 home)

`shore diff` prints a captured revision's diff — base to target, from the frozen captured snapshot
— as a human unified diff on stdout. Under ADR-0029's human-default convention it is
**human-only**: its human lane is its only lane (it offers no `--format json` initially — passing
one is an error; machine consumers keep using the review documents). It is non-interactive and
pipe-friendly (piped output is plain bytes), with pager and color only at a TTY under ADR-0029's
presentation rules (Decisions 4–5: `SHORE_PAGER`/`PAGER`, `--no-pager`, the `--color`/`NO_COLOR`
precedence, any future syntax coloring included), and its output is formally disposable — nothing
parses it.

Its subject is a captured revision, never the live working tree: `git diff` already owns the live
tree, and shore's bare verbs read against the review record per Decision 1. Revision selection
follows the review family's convention (explicit `--revision` when the store holds more than one
candidate); because the surface is disposable, more ergonomic head-resolution may evolve without
ceremony. A diffstat header and a stat-only option are expected; exact flags are implementation
design. Anchored review facts (observations pinned to lines) are **not** part of the initial
definition — if ever added, they stay a lightweight cue and do not re-implement the inspector's
annotated-diff lens.

### 3. The `show` collision is resolved: `show` belongs to the review record; the TUI is renamed

- **`shore review show` keeps its name** — the composite over a frozen revision, whose document
  form lives on the machine lane (`--format json`). Its future reshape (e.g. shedding the
  multi-megabyte row geometry) is soft-shell work under ADR-0029 Decisions 7 and 10, not this
  ADR.
- **Top-level `shore show` is retired as a name.** The TUI it fronts is renamed to
  **`shore notes show`** — subject-named for the job that distinguishes it (reading imported
  sidecar review notes anchored on the live working-tree diff, beside the existing
  `shore notes apply`) — and is explicitly marked **experimental** in `--help` and the CLI
  reference: the TUI has not had the investment to carry a stability expectation, and the
  experimental label says so while its fate is decided (Decision 6). As a bare working-tree
  pager it duplicates `git diff` and is not product surface; the notes overlay is why it exists,
  so the notes family is where it lives. The old name gets the standard removed-command
  migration hint (`src/cli/mod.rs:96-114` precedent), pointing to `shore notes show`
  (imported-notes viewing), `shore diff` (captured-revision readback), and `shore inspect`
  (deep reading).
- **Bare top-level `show` is not reused.** If the deferred TUI decision (Decision 6) ever
  produces a revision-era interactive surface, it arrives under an explicit name decided then;
  reserving the bare verb is not a commitment to fill it.

### 4. `shore up` is dropped

No derivable job: every candidate reading (status readout, recapture shortcut, inspector
launcher) collides with an existing surface (`shore store status`, explicit
`shore review capture --supersedes`, `shore inspect`) or with the standing guardrail that capture
modes lower through explicit adapters rather than ad hoc conveniences. The name is dropped from
the surface — not reserved. Any future proposal starts from a product case, not from the name.

### 5. `shore session` is absorbed

The job the name pointed at — reload/freshness status — is already served where the facts live:
`eventSetHash` freshness metadata on the ledger reads and `shore store status`. A thin `session`
wrapper would be a second home for the same facts, and "session" is an overloaded noun in the
internal model. Freshness readback for humans rides ADR-0029's human lane on the commands that
already own the data (the store digest and review digests), not a new verb. Dropped from the
surface.

### 6. `shore dump` is retired; the TUI's fate is deferred behind this ADR

- **`shore dump` is retired.** Zero found consumers; the integration-surface role its docs
  claimed passes to the review document family under ADR-0029's re-graded promise. Retirement
  ships with the standard removed-command hint. The `shore.dump` schema tag retires with the
  command; the `shore.review-notes` *input* sidecar schema (`shore notes apply`) is unaffected.
  The `DumpDocument` model remains internal plumbing for the renamed TUI while it lives.
- **The TUI decision is explicitly deferred behind this ADR; experimental status covers the
  interim.** Whether `shore notes show` is eventually re-plumbed onto the captured revision
  (mechanically bounded: point it at the existing revision projection and widen its row model)
  or retired outright is decided after `shore diff` and the digest layer ship, on two inputs:
  whether an interactive terminal reader still has pull once `shore diff` covers the SSH
  readback slice, and whether the imported-notes viewer job retains standalone value. Because
  the surface is marked experimental, either outcome — re-plumb, further rename, or retirement —
  needs no deprecation ceremony beyond the migration hint. Any future revision-era TUI is bound
  by Decision 7.

### 7. Terminal surfaces do not ASCII-clone the inspector

The digest layer (ADR-0029's human lane) and `shore diff` may mirror the inspector's
revision-page *header* — current assessment, open input requests, fact counts, diffstat — and no
more. The supersession DAG, the event timeline, the annotated cross-file diff with per-line
facts, and the endorsement web stay inspector-only. A terminal surface that starts growing a
lens the inspector already owns is out of scope by decision, not by omission.

## Consequences

### Accepted

- **#96 gets its home**: `shore diff` (this ADR) plus the bounded digests (ADR-0029's human lane)
  are the deliverable the issue's deferral pointed at; the composite `shore review show` stops
  masquerading as a human surface.
- **One `show` concept survives**: `show` means the review record (`shore review show`); the
  live-tree viewer is subject-named under `notes`. The rename costs muscle memory for anyone
  using the legacy TUI, mitigated by the migration hint.
- **The named surface shrinks honestly**: `up` and `session` exit the vocabulary instead of
  waiting indefinitely for jobs; `dump` exits with zero consumer impact. Fewer names, each with a
  defined job.
- **Deferral is recorded, not implied**: the TUI's fate has named decision inputs and a named
  constraint (Decision 7), so the next session inherits a decision point, not a vague hope.
- **Accepted cost**: retiring `shore dump` and renaming `shore show` are user-visible breaks to
  the legacy surface (softened by hints, and by the fact that the README stopped advertising both
  names). The `dump`/`show` byte-parity seam and TUI code remain in-tree until the deferred
  decision, carrying maintenance weight for a surface that may retire.

### Rejected

- **Re-pointing `shore show` at the captured revision now.** That is the TUI re-plumb by another
  name — it would decide the deferred question in the ADR, and it would silently change the
  subject of an existing command (the sharpest kind of muscle-memory break: same name, different
  data).
- **Retiring the TUI outright now.** Kills the imported-notes viewer job before the digest layer
  and `shore diff` demonstrate coverage; the deferral exists to make that call with evidence.
- **`shore diff` over the live working tree (git-diff parity).** Duplicates `git diff`, leaves
  the #96 readback gap unsolved, and violates Decision 1's subject rule.
- **`shore diff` as a rename of `shore dump`.** `dump` is machine JSON over the wrong subject
  (live tree); reusing its identity would drag the legacy model under a product name.
- **Keeping `shore up` or `shore session` as reserved names.** A reserved-undefined name in the
  surface invites planning a command because the name exists — the failure mode this audit found
  (a six-name table outliving the product's actual vocabulary).
- **A terminal DAG/timeline/annotated-diff.** The inspector owns relational and visual readback;
  ASCII clones would be worse tools and a second maintenance surface (Decision 7).

## Revisit Triggers

- **The deferred TUI decision** — after `shore diff` and the first digest wave ship: re-plumb
  `shore notes show` onto the revision projection, retire it, or leave it as the import viewer.
  Inputs per Decision 6.
- **`shore review show` reshape** — once shoreline-relay#11 resolves (per ADR-0029 Decision 10),
  the composite's row-geometry bulk becomes reshapeable; if that reshape lands, revisit whether
  `shore diff` should absorb any of its readback duties.
- **A real job materializes for a dropped name** — `up` or `session` may return only with a
  product case that names a job no existing surface serves.
- **Notes-import workflow evolution** — if sidecar-note import stops being a supported path, the
  renamed TUI and `shore notes` family shrink accordingly.
