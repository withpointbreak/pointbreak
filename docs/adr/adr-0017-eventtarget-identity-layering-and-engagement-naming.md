# ADR-0017: EventTarget Identity Layering, Object/Revision Separation, and Engagement/Journal Naming

**Status:** Accepted. §A1–A3 / §A5–A6 owner-approved 2026-06-19; the §A4 Engagement/Revision layering
refinement and its subsequent additions — all detailed in §A4 — re-approved through 2026-06-22:
engagement-derivation and the derived engagement lifecycle (no `EngagementOpened`/`Closed` events); the
`WorkObjectProposed` generative-move name (ranging over `WorkObjectType { Revision, TaskAttempt }`; surface
`shore review capture` unchanged); the wire-naming convention; the store-scope-layer rename
`Ledger`/`LedgerId`/`ledger_id`/`TargetRef::Ledger` → `Journal`/`JournalId`/`journal_id`/`TargetRef::Journal`
with the journal-cardinality clarification (a store holds one-to-many journals) and the store-as-log /
journal-as-scope rationale; the internal-naming-follows-the-layer rule (with `object` = content identity +
its stored artifact while `DiffSnapshot` keeps `snapshot`); and the `shore inspect` substrate-inspector
surface exception. Landed via the substrate-reshape implementation work, which also reconciles the
already-landed ADR-0016 to this ADR's target shape via an **ADR-0016 amendment** (ADR-0016's `session_id`
anchor predates this ADR's `session_id`→`journal_id` rename).
**Date:** 2026-06-19
**See also:** [substrate thesis summary](../substrate-thesis-summary.md) and
[substrate language](../substrate-language.md), plus ADR-0018 for supersession. This ADR **combines** the
identity-and-naming analysis into one record: identity layering is §A1–A3, and the Engagement/Journal
naming + the advisory-generative rule are §A4–A5. **Amends** in-repo ADR-0003 (advisory-first → extends to
generative moves; its Revisit Trigger 4 is the named hook) and ADR-0007 (writer-act vocabulary → capture is
the generative move any actor performs), each via its own appended amendment. **Coupled ADRs:** ADR-0018
(event-borne supersession replaces lineage — depends on this ADR's `Revision`), ADR-0019 (blackboard
attention/liveness — independent, parallel), and the one-time owner-run store migrations (depend on this
envelope).

## Context

*(Implementation status: this Context describes the **pre-reshape baseline** that motivated the decision.
The substrate-reshape implementation has since landed the reshaped `EventTarget` triple **and** the §A1/§A4
`Ledger`→`Journal` rename — current source is `EventTarget { journal_id, subject, track_id }`
(`src/session/event/target.rs`), with tests asserting the legacy `ledgerId` is absent — together with the
**deferred wire-key renames** (the third break, §A6) and the non-wire internal-identifier renames. The
"today …" descriptions below are the historical baseline, not current source.)*

Shoreline's event envelope addresses every fact through `EventTarget` (`src/session/event/target.rs:8-33`).
Today it is a flat bag of one required `session_id` plus eight optional fields — `work_unit_id`,
`work_object_id`, `work_object_type`, `review_unit_id`, `revision_id`, `snapshot_id`, `track_id`,
`subject` — with five constructors that each populate a different subset. *Which* optionals are set is
what silently encodes which domain a fact belongs to. This is three identity regimes accreted over time:
a pre-substrate `work_unit_id` vestige (read only by two sentinel guards,
`src/session/projection/state.rs:169,216`); the review triple `review_unit_id`/`revision_id`/`snapshot_id`;
and the substrate pair `work_object_id`/`work_object_type` that **only** task-domain events populate.

The substrate thesis claims `ReviewUnit` and `TaskAttempt` *share* `WorkObjectId` identity
(`docs/substrate-thesis-summary.md:32`). In the code this is false: the one place the two domains were
meant to converge is the one place they diverged — review kept its bespoke triple, tasks alone adopted
`work_object_id`. Two further facts ground the reshape:

- `revision_id` is literally `snapshot_id` re-prefixed — both are `…:sha256:<same descriptor hash>`
  (`src/session/store/fingerprint.rs:147,198`), a frozen 1:1 redundancy. And `review_unit_id`
  additionally folds a local-only `source_repo_namespace` (`fingerprint.rs:185-195`), so two clones of
  identical content get the same snapshot but **different** review-unit ids — identity does not converge.
- `target` is hashed **in full** inside both the TBS signing view (`src/session/event/tbs.rs:25`) and
  `event_record_hash` (`src/session/event/record_hash.rs:33`). Any field added, removed, or reordered in
  `EventTarget` invalidates every stored signature, all cross-store convergence, the co-signature
  transcription path, and the golden byte fixtures. There is no partial reshape.

This ADR is written **abstraction-down**: Shoreline is a canonical tamper-evident *agent-work
code-review* journal. The substrate's generality beyond code review is an open, falsifiable test
(the owner does not in practice route prose through the journal), **not** an
established platform. Nothing here is decided as if a general coordination substrate were proven.

Breaking changes are welcome: Shoreline has only a very early release, is unpromoted, and the owner is
the sole user. The migration's in-scope stores are the owner's working repos; their signing keys are **all
held locally**, so re-signing and co-signature re-attestation are real but **lossless** and the signature
blast radius does not constrain the reshape. The migration is handled by the one-time owner-run store
migrations.

## Decision

### A1. Reshape `EventTarget` to a non-optional addressed triple

`EventTarget` becomes exactly three fields:

```
EventTarget {
    journal_id: JournalId,          // the journal this event files into — a named logical scope over the store-log (renamed from session_id; see A4)
    subject:   TargetRef,         // non-optional; the single typed address into the work object
    track_id:  Option<TrackId>,   // attribution lane; absent for journal-scoped events (init/carrier)
}
```

The eight-optional bag is gone (only `track_id` survives, now the new triple's one optional field).
`subject` is a non-optional, externally-tagged `TargetRef`
(`src/model/work_object.rs:38-43`) — its variant *is* the domain regime, so "which regime" becomes
type-driven instead of "which optionals happen to be populated." The genuinely subject-less detached
co-signature carrier (which addresses its target through its payload's `target_event_id` +
`target_event_record_hash`, `target.rs:93-110`) gets a single, fieldless, journal-scoped variant
**`TargetRef::Journal`** — the carrier files into its journal by the envelope's `journal_id`, and its
co-signed target stays addressed by content in the payload, never duplicated onto the envelope. This is
the one carrier shape used throughout; `subject` is never `None`.

### A2. `subject` is the single shared identity; retire `work_unit_id`; fold the substrate pair

- **Retire `work_unit_id`** and its `"work:default"` sentinel (a pre-substrate vestige carrying no
  semantic load). It is *written* by note import on both `ReviewInitialized` and every
  `ReviewNoteImported` event (both use `EventTarget::new(session_id, work_unit_id)`, `workflow/import.rs:71`)
  and is embedded in the imported-note idempotency key (`import.rs:187-192`); but it is *read* only through
  the two sentinel guards (`projection/state.rs:169,216`), never by a projection decision. Retiring it drops
  the field and changes the imported-note key scheme (so those note files re-key/rename) — folded into the
  one-time owner-run store migration.
- **Fold `work_object_id` / `work_object_type` into `subject`.** "Is this a task attempt" becomes
  `matches!(subject, Task(..))`, and the object id lives inside the variant. The review and task domains
  now address through *one* `TargetRef`. This is the actual realization of the "shared identity" the
  thesis claimed but never delivered — it is `subject`, not a `WorkObjectId` sibling field.

### A3. Separate the redundant object/revision pair; object identity is content-only and git-optional

Today `revision_id ≡ snapshot_id` (the same descriptor hash) and both ride sibling envelope fields. This
ADR **separates** them into two layers, **both carried in the generative move's payload, not the
envelope**:

- **Object identity** = `sha256` of a **content-only projection** of the diff (paths, statuses, rename
  `old_path`, row kind+text, intrinsic flags). It **drops** git blob OIDs, modes, line/hunk numbers,
  `FileId`/`HunkId`, and the local-only `source_repo_namespace` from identity (they remain as provenance
  in the stored artifact), and **sorts the file set by path** so identity is set-based, not array-order
  dependent (`fingerprint.rs:232,253` currently hash a `Vec` positionally). This makes two clones of
  identical content **converge** to the same object id, and makes a non-git object (e.g. a markdown set)
  expressible — generality becomes *robust* rather than accidental.
- **Revision** is a **distinct** logical layer that folds the object id plus **optional** git provenance
  (base/target commit+tree OIDs). It is the carrier of "this content positioned at these (optional) git
  endpoints," and is what supersession references (ADR-0018).
- **Per-diff git endpoints live on the Revision** (the code binds endpoints 1:1 with the snapshot and
  mints `revision_id` from the same hash, `fingerprint.rs:179-206`). The **only** genuinely
  activity-scoped git fact — the capture-time branch ref (`RevisionRefAssociated` in current source — the
  ADR-0014 wire rename has landed; `capture.rs:274-302`) — stays scoped to the
  engagement/journal and is already non-identity. Object
  identity folds neither.

### A4. Naming and the typed Engagement: `Journal`, `Engagement {Review|Task}`, `Revision` (the work object), `Object` (its content sub-layer)

*(Revised 2026-06-19 to absorb the owner-ratified Engagement/Revision layering refinement. The §A1–A3
decisions are unchanged; this sharpens the names and folds `ReviewUnit` into `Revision`.)*

The word "session" is overloaded — `SessionId` (`src/model/ids.rs:22`, renamed from `reviewId`) names the
per-event top scope, and it collides with the "working session" activity. Rename to free the word and name
each layer. The physical container is the **store** — the single append-only event log every envelope files
into (§A1); within it the logical layers nest **Journal ⊃ Engagement ⊃ Revision ⊃ (Object)**, the journal
being the top *logical* scope over the log (see *Journal cardinality* and *Why `Journal`* below):

| Layer | Old name(s) | New name |
|---|---|---|
| top logical scope over the store-log (the envelope's `*_id`) | `SessionId` | **`Journal` / `JournalId`** (A1) |
| the domain activity around an object — **typed** | *(none — `session_id` was a dead sentinel)* | **`Engagement` / `EngagementId`**, with an **`EngagementType { Review, Task }`** |
| the captured, fact-carrying **work object** (`WorkObjectType` variant) | `ReviewUnit` / `review_unit_id` | **`Revision` / `RevisionId`** — `ReviewUnit` folds into it; `WorkObjectType { Revision, TaskAttempt }` |
| the **content sub-identity** of a Revision (not a work object) | `SnapshotId` | **`Object` / `ObjectId`** — `Revision { id, object_id, git_provenance }` (A3) |

**Journal cardinality — a store holds *one-to-many* journals.** The **store** is the single append-only
event log (`.git/shore`, **unpartitioned** — one content-addressed event set); a **journal** is a *named
logical scope over that log*, and `journal_id` is a **per-event scope** (a filter applied on read), not a
store constant or a physical partition. One store may therefore carry events addressed to several
`journal_id`s: the review path currently defaults to a single `journal:default` (so plain `shore review`
work is **one journal per store today**), but import adapters mint a **distinct journal per imported
session** (e.g. `journal:claude:<uuid>`, `adapter/claude_code/parse.rs`), and ADR-0019's *whole-`Journal`*
liveness scope presumes the multiplicity. So the journal is the **top logical scope within** the store, not
the store itself; engagements group *within* a journal (above), and that grouping is journal-bounded.
Whether the log should ever be **physically** partitioned by journal (vs. the current filter-on-read over
one log) is a separate open layout question, deliberately **out of scope here** — this ADR decides the
naming and the logical layering, not the on-disk layout (tracked in issue #202).

**Why `Journal`, not `Ledger` or `Log` (rationale refreshed 2026-06-22).** The layering separates two
things one name had blurred: the **store** is the single **append-only event log** — the durable substrate
every envelope files into — and a **journal** is a *named logical scope over that log* (a *topic*, in the
generic named-stream sense; one store, one-to-many journals, above). Naming the **scope** layer is the open
question, and two facts settle it:

- **`Log` names the substrate, not the scope.** The append-only log *is* the store, and we already call
  that layer the **store** (`shore store`, `.shore`, `store.json`) — so "log" is the store's role, not a
  second name for the scope, and minting a `Log` type would collide head-on with the diagnostic logging
  already in the tree (`tracing` / `tracing-subscriber`). The scope riding over the log is what we are
  naming, and `Journal` names it precisely: the chronological *book of original entry* for that scope, whose
  derived views (`SessionState`, the current-assessment / supersession-DAG / per-revision projections) are
  the *ledger-like aggregations*.
- **`Ledger` named the derivation, and cued blockchain.** In accounting the journal is the source and the
  ledger is the posted derivation, so "Ledger" named the append-only scope after its own derived views; it
  also strongly cues *distributed-ledger / blockchain*, which Shoreline explicitly is **not** (ADR-0019: no
  executive controller; convergent, not consensus).

`Journal` is accurate for a scope over an append-only log, carries no blockchain connotation, and is an
established systems term (journaling FS / DB journal / event-sourcing journal) with no collision in the
tree. The store-as-log / journal-as-scope split is a layering *intuition*, **not** an adoption of any log
system's machinery: Shoreline does not physically partition the log per journal (an open layout question,
#202), and a journal keys on **provenance** (the review default; a per-import session) rather than
subject-matter, so the named-stream analogy is structural only. The container is **internal + wire
vocabulary** (`journal_id`, `TargetRef::Journal`) — **no primary `shore review` CLI/UI surface change** (the
`shore inspect` substrate-inspector excepted — §A4 (viii)); the wire rename rides a
second signed-store break (§A6), whose throwaway re-keying migrator maps `ledger_id`→`journal_id` (and the
value prefix `ledger:`/`session:` → `journal:`). (The earlier choice
"Ledger" was only to free "session" and because it was the dialogue's word, never a
technical claim, so nothing load-bearing is lost.)

**`Review` is the `Engagement` type, not the unit.** "Review" names the *domain/activity* (sibling to
`Task`), and is the precise home for the noun — distinct from the `shore review` verb and from the
captured unit. A **Revision is to review what a TaskAttempt is to task**: one captured instance of the
domain's work, carrying observations/assessments, what supersession operates over, what `File`/`Range`
anchors key on.

**`ReviewUnit` folds into `Revision` — and the convergence is from the reshape, not a rename.** This is
load-bearing, so state the mechanism precisely. Today the ids fold *different* material:
`revision_id = rev:git:sha256:<snapshot_hash>` (the *snapshot descriptor* hash — which today still folds
git blob OIDs and, for commit ranges, the `base_tree_oid`/`target_tree_oid` pair, `fingerprint.rs:224-253`;
"content-only" is what the **reshaped Object** becomes after A3's content projection, not this hash) while
`review_unit_id = sha256(source_repo_namespace, source, base, target, snapshot_id)` folds the **endpoints**
on top (`fingerprint.rs:186-200`). They converge **only because A3 redefines the layers**: the **endpoints
move into the Revision** (as `git_provenance`) and the **content moves into the Object**, after which
review_unit and revision fold *identical* material (`object_id` + git provenance). `source_repo_namespace`
leaves identity (A3); the `source` worktree-vs-range bit is recoverable from the endpoint *types* and the
single-variant capture-mode discriminants retire, so nothing review_unit folded
survives outside the reshaped Revision. The **semantic clincher**: ADR-0018 removes the lineage container, so
no handle survives *above* the captured position — the position **is** the unit. Therefore
`ReviewUnit ≡ Revision`. (The wire-level rename — `review_unit_id`→`revision_id`, `ReviewTargetRef::ReviewUnit`
→`Revision`, `WorkObjectType {Revision, TaskAttempt}`, the idempotency-key prefixes — rode the first
signed-store break (the `EventTarget` reshape); the residual frozen `reviewUnitId` content-id digest keys
complete in the third break (§A6). Each rides a reshape break, not a separate migration.)

**`Object` is a content sub-layer of `Revision`, not a `WorkObjectType` sibling.** `Object` is the
git-optional content hash (A3) that lets two clones' revisions converge and that `--object` groups by; it
is referenced by `Revision.object_id` (**many revisions → one object**, preserving dedup), never addressed
or fact-attached directly. Promoting `Object` to a third work-object kind would re-introduce the
object/revision/work-object three-way the reshape removes.

**`TargetRef` is two-level, with one type-enforced domain axis (the diverged-`WorkObjectId` guard, applied
one layer up).** The outer variant is the *domain* (`Review` | `Task`, the same word as `EngagementType`);
the inner is the *work object* (`Revision`, plus the `File`/`Range` sub-anchors). So
`TargetRef::Review(ReviewTarget::Revision{ revision_id })` replaces the old
`Review(ReviewTargetRef::ReviewUnit{ review_unit_id })`; `File`/`Range` key on `revision_id`. The domain
now appears structurally in two places — `EngagementType` and the `TargetRef` outer variant — and **they
must never disagree.** Keep **one domain axis with a single source of truth**: the subject's domain is
**structurally derived from / type-checked against its engagement** (a `Review` engagement addresses only
`Revision` subjects, never `TaskAttempt`), **never an independently-asserted wire value**. This is exactly
the `WorkObjectId`-claimed-but-diverged failure (one fact, two encodings) that this ADR exists to fix —
do not re-create it one layer up.

**The typed `Engagement` is abstraction-down, not a platform.** `EngagementType` is closed at
`{ Review, Task }` because those are the **two domains that exist** — code review and the task-supervision
prototype the substrate thesis keeps as a flat work object. A third type (e.g. prose) is a future *stress
test* the enum could admit **without claiming or building it**. Add no machinery that only a hypothetical
third type would need.

`engagement_id` is **carried in the generative move's payload, not the envelope** (owner-ratified
2026-06-19: `journal_id` on the envelope, `engagement_id` in payload). It is the activity binding that
co-locates competing revisions of the same engagement; projections may use it as a **hint/index**, but the
**authoritative grouping derives from the supersession DAG** (see the engagement-derivation rules below).
This keeps the envelope
minimal, matches the `supersedes`-in-payload placement (ADR-0018), and follows the substrate's
project-over-store discipline; the surface is indifferent to the placement.

**An Engagement is *derived*, never *initiated*.** `capture` is the revision-layer generative move — it records a `Revision`; it does **not**
"open" an activity. There is **no `EngagementInitiated` event and no stored "current open activity"
scalar**; the Engagement is the **supersession-connected component of revisions within a `Journal`**
(ADR-0018), a **derived, authoritative** grouping. The payload `engagement_id` is a **write-time-derived
hint/cache** of it, **never an actor-supplied value**. The rules, implementation-complete:

1. **Write-time derivation of the `engagement_id` hint.** A **root** capture (empty `supersedes`) derives
   its `engagement_id` from its own (root) revision. A superseding capture whose predecessors are
   **present** **inherits** their shared `engagement_id` (exact). The writer computes it from the
   `supersedes` edge; an actor never supplies it.
2. **Dangling predecessor — no gate.** Because ADR-0018 accepts a `supersedes` target not yet in the store (a
   `supersession_target_missing` diagnostic, **never** a write rejection — ADR-0003), the writer cannot
   always read a predecessor's `engagement_id`. Rule: **accept the write**; derive a **deterministic
   provisional** `engagement_id` from canonical inputs available at write time (the `supersedes` *target
   ids*, e.g. the lexicographically-least); emit the missing-target diagnostic. On **backfill** the
   grouping projection reconciles via the same self-heal path — the connected component absorbs the
   revision, and a provisional hint that now disagrees is overridden by the projection (and surfaced, rule
   3), **without re-stamping** the immutable events.
3. **Cross-engagement bridge — surface, do not gate.** A capture whose `supersedes` spans revisions in
   **two engagements** is likewise **not rejected**. Its stored `engagement_id` is a deterministic
   representative (lexicographically-least of its predecessors'); the grouping projection **unifies the
   connected component** and emits an **`engagements_merged { merged_ids, by_revision }`** diagnostic.
   Older revisions are **never re-stamped**.

**Single source of truth.** The supersession DAG (within the `Journal`) is **authoritative**;
`engagement_id` is a derived hint — **exact when predecessors are present, provisional + diagnosed when
they are not, never independently asserted, and never *silently* divergent** (every disagreement surfaces
as a diagnostic). This is the §A4 domain-axis discipline applied to engagement membership, honoring
ADR-0003's no-write-gate and ADR-0018's surface-don't-reject posture.

The "I'm engaging with object X" cue *before* any revision is produced is **ADR-0019 derived attention
state**, not an engagement write — it never mints journal state.

**The engagement lifecycle is *observed*, not declared.** "Open / in-progress / closed" is a **derived
projection**, never lifecycle events. An engagement's **start** is its root revision (the supersedes-empty
generative move); its **end**, *where a domain defines one*, is the domain-natural terminal. A `Review`
engagement is terminal when its **current-assessment projection resolves to a single un-replaced
`Accepted`** (`src/session/event/assessment.rs` `ReviewAssessment::Accepted`); a *competing/ambiguous*
current-assessment set keeps the engagement **in-progress** (ADR-0018 / ADR-0008 ambiguity preservation —
ambiguity is not a terminal). A `Task` engagement has **no terminal in V1**: the task vocabulary
(attempt / checkpoint / observation) defines no completion move, so its derived lifecycle is start +
in-progress only, and a task terminal is **deferred** to a future task-completion evaluative move (never a
generic `EngagementClosed`). *In-progress* is an engagement with un-superseded current heads and no
resolved terminal. There is **no
`EngagementOpened`/`Closed` event**: an empty "opened" engagement would be the current-state scalar the
substrate forbids, and "closed" would be either a derivable signal or a write-gate (append-only journals
have no enforceable "end"). The three move kinds bracket the lifecycle — generative opens/advances,
evaluative (assessment) is the terminal, coordinative pauses — so Shoreline **observes** the lifecycle from
the domain moves rather than imposing one. (A future need for an *authoritative* archived state is a named
ADR-0003 executive-policy Revisit Trigger, not a default.)

**The generative move is internally `WorkObjectProposed`; `capture` is a surface verb only.** The
domain-neutral generative move/event is **`WorkObjectProposed`** — it produces a **work object** (a
`Revision` in the review domain, a `TaskAttempt` in the task domain: the two `WorkObjectType` variants),
and the `…Proposed` suffix foregrounds the advisory-generative rule (§A5: the produced work object is a
*proposal*, never operative). The name **ranges over `WorkObjectType { Revision, TaskAttempt }` rather than
either variant**, because the generative move is **not review-specific**: the task
domain's capture is equally a generative move over a different object. It replaces the per-domain
`ReviewUnitCaptured` / `TaskAttemptCaptured` families §A2 collapses into one generative family; *which*
work object a given move produced is carried by the payload's `subject` (`TargetRef`), not encoded in the
event name. **`shore review capture` stays the user-facing review surface verb**: the surface stays
domain-named while internal vocabulary differs. "capture" / "the generative move" wherever it appears in
§A2/§A5, ADR-0018, and the ADR-0007 amendment all denote `WorkObjectProposed`. (Naming the move
`RevisionProposed` after the **review** work object — a *sibling* of `TaskAttempt`, not their genus — is
**rejected**: a single collapsed move named after one `WorkObjectType` variant privileges one domain and
re-introduces, in the move name, the very one-domain-favoring asymmetry §A4 removes from identity; the
`TargetRef` would disambiguate, so it is a naming-clarity defect, not a correctness one. `start`/`open` are
likewise **not** used for this move — they would smuggle in the lifecycle events rejected above.)

**Wire-naming convention (the one rule `WorkObjectProposed` and every domain-named family both follow).**
An event-type name reaches for the **abstract `WorkObject` term only when the event is genuinely
cross-domain** — i.e. it ranges over **both** `WorkObjectType` variants **and** that cross-domain symmetry is
*load-bearing* (the move is the single home of machinery that would otherwise be duplicated per domain).
**Exactly one event meets this:** the generative move `WorkObjectProposed`, the single home of `supersedes`
(ADR-0018), the derived `engagement_id` (above), and the advisory-generative default (§A5). **Every other event
names the most specific accurate thing** — a **domain work object** (`Review…` / `Task…`, including the
`Revision{Ref,Commit}{Associated,Withdrawn}` association family, ADR-0014 amendment) when it is tied to one
domain, or its **own non-work-object concept** (`InputRequest…`, `ValidationCheckRecorded`,
`EventSignatureRecorded`, `ArtifactRemoved`) when it is not about a work object at all. So
`WorkObjectProposed` is **not an exception**: it is the sole current member of the *cross-domain,
load-bearing* category, and domain-specific families are **not** to be renamed up to `WorkObject*` — that
would be the abstraction-up the reshape rejects, claiming a generality that does not exist (e.g. there
is no task-domain commit/ref association). Internal wire vocabulary may be substrate-flavored (`object_id`,
`engagement_id`); the **primary surface** stays domain-named regardless (the `shore inspect`
substrate-inspector is the one deliberate exception — see the surface rule below).

**"review" stays the only user-facing surface verb** (`shore review …`). The `unit` noun retires: within
the `shore review` namespace the captured unit is a **`revision`** (`shore review capture` creates one;
`shore review revisions` / `show <revision>` / `--revision` / `--object` per ADR-0018). `Journal` /
`Engagement` / `EngagementType` and the generative/evaluative/coordinative move vocabulary are
**internal**; `object` / `revision` are permitted domain surface terms. None of the internal
vocabulary reaches a CLI flag or a rendered UI label **on the primary `shore review` surface**. The
**`shore inspect` substrate-inspector is a deliberate exception**: its served documents and UI intentionally
expose substrate vocabulary (`journal`, `engagement`, `revision`, `object`) because inspecting the substrate
is their purpose — e.g. the inspect served key is `journalId`. The primary surface's journal-*selector* (how a
user scopes a command to a journal) stays a separate, **domain-named** question that does **not** adopt
`journal` literally.

**Internal naming follows the layer.** Where the surface rule above fixes the *user-facing* terms
(`review`/`revision`/`object` only) and the wire-naming convention fixes *event* names, this fixes the
*internal* identifiers (types, fields, fns, modules) so the vocabulary stays single-sourced: name a symbol
for **the layer it denotes**. The **domain/activity** is `review` (the `EngagementType`); a **single captured
work object** is `revision` (the `ReviewUnit`→`Revision` fold — the `unit` vocabulary retires *entirely*,
internal as well as surface); the **supersession-connected component** is `engagement` (the derived
grouping); and the **content identity** is `object` (the `obj:` hash). One distinction is load-bearing: a
set of revisions **grouped by shared content/base** (ADR-0018's base auto-grouping) is a **`revision` set**
(e.g. `grouped_revision_ids`), **not** an `engagement` — `engagement` is reserved for the
*supersession*-connected component, a different relation, so the two groupings never share a name. And
`object` names the **content identity and its stored artifact** (`ObjectArtifact`, the `artifacts/objects/`
store, the `/api/object` route — the addressable/stored content layer); the **diff-body render model**
(`DiffSnapshot`) keeps the `snapshot` name — a captured point-in-time diff, used even where no stored object
exists (live rendering), distinct from the `object` identity/storage layer.

### A5. Capture is the generative move, performed by any actor, and stays Advisory

`capture` is the **generative move**, and the substrate already lets any actor perform it — it accepts an
arbitrary `--actor` and ties identity to content, not the writer (`capture.rs:95-103,792-817`). The
author/reviewer asymmetry is **policy in the skills**, not a substrate property; a reviewer may
counter-propose by capturing a revision that supersedes the author's (ADR-0018), with no new event type and
no CLI enforcement.

**Generative moves default to, and remain, Advisory; they are never promotable to Operative.** A
`supersedes`-carrying proposal that a projection could mark "approved — implement it" is one projection
from the workflow engine the substrate refuses (`docs/substrate-language.md`, ADR-0003). This is the
highest-stakes constraint in the reshape. It **amends ADR-0003** — whose Revisit Trigger 4 ("a concrete
multi-agent workflow needs scope-bounded authority…") is the named hook — to state advisory-first
applies to generative moves, and **relates to ADR-0007** (the review act tracks the move kind; role
stays a derived persona, not a substrate fact). Note (as-built flag for those amendments):
`ReviewAssessmentRecorded` today defaults *Operative* (`src/session/event/mod.rs:73-78`); the generative
move must default and stay Advisory.

### A6. The reshape is a clean signed-store break — no shim, no dual-read, no versioned target

Because `target` is in both the TBS view and `event_record_hash`, the reshape invalidates every
signature, all `event_record_hash` convergence, the co-signature transcription branch, and the golden
fixtures — by design. There is **no** compatibility shim, **no** dual-read of the old target shape, and
**no** versioned target. In practice the reshape lands in **three** clean signed-store breaks rather
than one: first the `EventTarget` reshape (the identity triple, lineage retirement, and the generative-move
and `review_unit`→`revision` event-type/wire renames); then the `Ledger`→`Journal` container rename together
with the stored `snapshot_id`→`object_id` object-field rename; then the deferred wire-key renames — the
residual frozen `reviewUnitId` content-id digest keys (completing `review_unit`→`revision`) and the
snapshot-artifact → object-artifact concept (the artifact `schema` `"shore.snapshot"`→`"shore.object"`,
`snapshotArtifactContentHash`→`objectArtifactContentHash`, `artifacts/snapshots/`→`artifacts/objects/`,
`/api/snapshot`→`/api/object`). Each stage was decided after the prior break had already landed, so each rides its
own break rather than being folded backward. Each is a clean break with the same posture, and each is
migrated once by a throwaway re-keying migrator that is deleted afterward — a one-time owner-run migration per break;
all signer keys are held locally, so re-signing and co-signature re-attestation are real but
lossless. Legacy-rejection tests for the old shapes are deleted and the golden vectors regenerated at each
break. The reshaped
store's read path stays strict — a loud rejection of any stray old-shape file is a feature.

## Consequences

### Accepted

- **One shared identity, finally.** Review and task objects address through a single non-optional
  `subject`; the diverged `WorkObjectId` claim is resolved by the type, not papered over. The
  substrate-thesis-summary doc must reflect that correction.
- **Clone convergence and git-optional generality.** Dropping `source_repo_namespace` and git OIDs from
  identity makes two clones converge and makes a non-git object expressible. (Generality remains an open
  test — this enables it; it does not prove it.)
- **Distinct object/revision cardinality** replaces the frozen 1:1:1, enabling one object to carry many
  revisions over an engagement (the substrate for fork-tolerant supersession, ADR-0018).
- **A smaller, type-safe envelope** and ~2 constructors instead of 5; illegal "which optionals are set"
  states become unrepresentable.
- **A cleaner surface.** The CLI's one substrate-leaking noun (`lineage`) is removed by ADR-0018, and no new
  substrate vocabulary reaches the **primary `shore review` surface** (the `shore inspect` substrate-inspector
excepted — §A4 (viii)); "review" stays the only verb.
- **Costs accepted:** a total signed-store break (a one-shot, owner-run migrator); every `EventTarget`
  constructor, projection, and idempotency-key builder is touched; the golden fixtures and the
  legacy-rejection tests are regenerated/deleted; `shore review history` output changes (the
  `change_id` and duplicated-`subject` fields are decision-dead but output-live — their removal is a
  visible output diff taken at the break).

### Rejected

- **Candidate B (an explicit `object_id` sibling field on the envelope alongside `subject`).** It
  duplicates, for the whole-object case, the id already inside `subject` — exactly the duplication this
  reshape removes (`for_review_unit` commits it today, `target.rs:61-67`). `subject` is the single
  identity.
- **Keeping the flat optional triple / a versioned or dual-read target.** Dual-read is the tool for
  un-re-signable bound bytes (other actors' co-signatures); the owner has none, so a one-shot migrator
  strictly dominates. The store is unreleased; there is no reader to keep compatible.
- **`engagement_id` on the signed envelope.** It would enlarge the signed/convergence-bound target for
  envelope-level grouping the projection provides anyway; the payload placement is smaller and the
  surface is indifferent.
- **Framing this as a general coordination substrate.** Abstraction-up is the failure mode the earlier
  challenges name; this ADR hardens the agent-work code-review journal and leaves generality an open test.

## Revisit Triggers

- A second object-domain is admitted for real and passes the substrate thesis's marginal-cost bar, then needs
  identity or addressing shapes this `subject`/`Object`/`Revision` model
  cannot express without a per-domain special case — i.e. the layering would merely *rename* a new
  divergence.
- A non-local repo-namespace model lands and convergence needs a namespace concept back **outside** the
  object identity.
- The advisory-generative line is pressured: a real workflow needs a proposal treated as operative —
  reopen via ADR-0003's executive-policy exception, naming it directly, never as ordinary metadata.
- A released contract or a second user appears, so "breaking changes welcome / one-shot migrate" no
  longer holds and a compatibility strategy is genuinely required.

## Amendment: Exact Generation Addressing and Derived Review Threads (2026-07-19)

ADR-0017's Object/Revision identity layering stands. [ADR-0037](./adr-0037-immutable-review-generations-and-fact-continuity.md)
adds `GenerationRefV1 { revision_id, object_artifact_content_hash }` as the exact read and fact-currency
address. `RevisionId` continues to identify the immutable proposal position; the bound artifact hash
identifies the concrete reviewed bytes. Exact routes, DTOs, cache keys, and editor resources must carry or
verify the pair and reject mismatches rather than falling back.

Engagement/review-thread identity remains derived, never a signed fact target or content owner. Its
membership projection now spans both replacement `supersedes` edges and non-replacing `continues` edges;
replacement currency still uses only `supersedes`. Several exact generations may therefore be current in one
thread. Facts, validation, assessments, association evidence, and ports always retain exact generation
identity and never target the derived thread.

The clean-break posture is also constrained: migration preserves legacy decoded bytes, IDs, signatures, and
attribution. It may not invent generation boundaries, continuation intent, relation evidence, fact ports, or
document coverage. New semantic families require one fail-closed logical capability cohort before their
first production write.

## Amendment: Change Is the Stable Review Work Object (2026-08-06)

[ADR-0042](./adr-0042-stable-changes-exact-revisions-and-explicit-activation.md) adds the stable
review-domain layer above the exact captured state:

```text
ChangeId -> RevisionRefV1 -> ObjectId
```

Change is the user-visible multi-round review work object. Revision remains the immutable captured-state
subject addressed by the existing `EventTarget`/`TargetRef` shape, and Object remains its content identity.
Facts therefore stay exact-Revision targeted; they do not float to Change. The existing generic
`WorkObjectProposed::Revision` wire is not renamed or duplicated. Change declaration and membership are
separate append-only claims, so this amendment preserves A1-A6's non-optional EventTarget triple and signed
Revision/Object layering rather than introducing another target discriminator. Change claims use
journal-scoped `TargetRef::Journal` without a `track_id` or envelope `subjectId`: interactive writers use
`journal:default`, while bulk adoption preserves the legacy root's journal id. Attribution comes from the
event actor.

Change replaces derived Engagement/thread connectivity as the review-work grouping for current writers.
The retained proposal `engagement_id` is a legacy/internal payload hint and, because Change-era proposals
leave proposal-borne relations empty, is not authority for Change membership or current selection.
`RevisionRefV1` replaces `GenerationRefV1` as the exact read and fact-currency address, and the earlier
`supersedes ∪ continues` membership projection is retired.
