# Review Workflow

This document describes the intended end-to-end workflow for reviewing a
tool-assisted change with Shore today. Command reference details live in the
`README.md`; this is the narrative version that explains *when* to run each
command and *why*.

## What Shore reviews

Shore reviews a **ReviewUnit**: the base endpoint, the target endpoint, and a
captured diff snapshot taken at a single moment. V1 captures the local Git
worktree from `HEAD` to the working tree, including untracked files.

Each ReviewUnit gets its own immutable snapshot artifact. Anything you record
afterwards — observations, interventions, dispositions — attaches to that
ReviewUnit and lives in the durable `.shore/events/` log.

## The workflow at a glance

1. Start from a Git worktree containing the change you want to review.
2. Capture a ReviewUnit with `shore review capture`.
3. Inspect what was captured with `shore review unit show` and
   `shore review history`.
4. Record review facts as you read the diff:
   - **Observations** are notes you want preserved.
   - **Interventions** are durable pause/decision requests for someone else.
   - **Dispositions** are the final outcome for the ReviewUnit (or for a file,
     range, or specific fact within it).
5. Optionally use `shore notes apply`, `shore dump`, and `shore show` for
   import and read-only inspection of the older review-stream surface.

The rest of this document walks through each step.

## 1. Start in a worktree with the change

Shore expects to run inside a Git worktree where the working tree differs from
`HEAD`. The change can come from anywhere — a coding agent, a teammate's WIP
branch, your own edits — but it must be present in the working tree before
capture. Shore reads the diff from `git`; it does not summarize prior commits
on its own.

```bash
cd path/to/worktree
git status        # confirm the changes you expect are present
```

The first Shore command run in the worktree will create local `.shore/`
storage and add `.shore/` to `.gitignore` when needed.

## 2. Capture a ReviewUnit

```bash
shore review capture
```

`shore review capture` records a `review_unit_captured` event and writes the
captured snapshot as an immutable Shore-owned artifact. The output document is
`shore.review-capture` JSON and includes:

- the ReviewUnit ID
- the revision ID
- the snapshot ID
- the snapshot artifact's canonical content hash

You can pin later commands to the captured ReviewUnit with `--review-unit
<id>`. When only one ReviewUnit exists in `.shore/`, the read commands pick
it automatically. When multiple exist, list them with
`shore review unit list` and pass the ID you want.

The snapshot is now frozen. Re-running `shore review capture` later creates a
new ReviewUnit; it does not mutate the previous one.

## 3. Inspect what was captured

Three read surfaces describe ReviewUnits, and they answer different questions:

```bash
shore review unit list     # what ReviewUnits exist in .shore/
shore review unit show     # composite ReviewUnit view (narrative + snapshot)
shore review history       # chronological raw event listing
```

### `shore review unit list`

`shore review unit list` projects every `review_unit_captured` event into a
flat directory of ReviewUnits. It is the discovery surface — start here when
`shore review unit show` errors with `multiple captured review units; pass
--review-unit`, or whenever you need to pick an ID for `--review-unit <id>`.

It returns `shore.review-unit-list` JSON with `eventSetHash`, `eventCount`,
`reviewUnitCount`, and an `entries` array whose elements include
`reviewUnitId`, `capturedAt`, `revisionId`, `snapshotId`, `source`, `base`,
`target`, and `snapshotArtifactContentHash`. Entries are sorted by capture
time so the newest ReviewUnit appears last.

```bash
shore review unit list --pretty
```

### `shore review unit show`

`shore review unit show` is the composite view of one ReviewUnit. It returns
`shore.review-unit` JSON containing:

- ReviewUnit identity and event-set freshness metadata
- summary counts and current disposition status
- native observations, interventions, and dispositions
- imported adapter notes
- projection rows (narrative-first, then snapshot-complete)
- diagnostics

Narrative rows (native facts and imported notes) appear before the snapshot
remainder, but the snapshot remainder still includes every captured file,
metadata row, hunk header, and diff row. Track filters narrow narrative facts
without changing snapshot completeness.

```bash
shore review unit show --pretty
shore review unit show --track agent:codex
shore review unit show --include-body
```

### `shore review history`

`shore review history` is the chronological raw-event listing across the
entire `.shore/events/` log — across ReviewUnits if there is more than one.
It is the place to answer "what happened, in what order?" rather than
"what does this ReviewUnit look like right now?".

```bash
shore review history --pretty
shore review history --event-type review-observation-recorded
shore review history --review-unit <id> --include-body
```

`eventSetHash` and `eventCount` describe the full validated event set used to
build the document, even when filters return only a subset of entries.
History preserves duplicate semantic events as separate entries; it does not
collapse them or pick "winners".

## 4. Record review facts

The three event families below are append-only. Each writes one durable event
per call. Read surfaces collapse same-semantic-ID writes to one logical row
and surface a duplicate diagnostic.

### Observations

An observation is a durable note for a ReviewUnit, a file, or a line range.
Observations are append-only; corrections are new observations that name the
older observation through `--supersedes`.

```bash
# Review-wide observation
shore review observation add \
  --track agent:codex \
  --title "Check error handling near IO boundary"

# File-targeted observation
shore review observation add \
  --track agent:codex \
  --title "Untrusted input flows here" \
  --file src/lib.rs

# Range-targeted observation, with a body from a file
shore review observation add \
  --track human:kevin \
  --title "Worth a unit test" \
  --file src/lib.rs --start-line 42 --end-line 58 \
  --body-file notes/lib-42.md

# Replay observations for one track
shore review observation list --track agent:codex --pretty

# Include bodies on read
shore review observation list --include-body
```

Bodies may come from `--body`, `--body-file`, or `--body-stdin`. Large bodies
are stored as Shore-owned content-addressed artifacts; command output never
exposes those paths.

### Interventions

An intervention is a durable pause/decision request. Use it when a reviewer
or tool needs an explicit answer before proceeding. `--mode` defaults to
`blocking`; `advisory` requests are still durable but do not imply that a
cooperative client must pause.

```bash
shore review intervention request \
  --track human:kevin \
  --title "Need approval to land schema change" \
  --reason manual-decision-required

shore review intervention list                 # defaults to open
shore review intervention list --status all
shore review intervention fetch <intervention-id> --include-body

shore review intervention resolve <intervention-id> \
  --outcome approved \
  --reason "discussed in chat, ok to land"
```

`--reason` on the request is the classification axis (`manual-decision-required`,
`ambiguous-state`, `unsafe-action`, etc.). `--outcome` on the resolve is a
separate axis (`approved`, `rejected`, `dismissed`, `superseded`, `abandoned`).

Multiple different resolution events are preserved as append-only facts and
make the intervention `ambiguous` rather than picking a timestamp winner.

### Dispositions

A disposition is the final review outcome for a ReviewUnit, a file, a range,
or a specific native observation/intervention/disposition in the same
ReviewUnit. V1 values: `accepted`, `accepted-with-follow-up`, `needs-changes`,
`needs-clarification`, `overridden`, `deferred`, `split-out`, `superseded`.

```bash
shore review disposition add \
  --track human:kevin \
  --disposition accepted \
  --summary "looks good, ship it"

# Disposition that overrides an older one
shore review disposition add \
  --track human:kevin \
  --disposition overridden \
  --summary "supersedes earlier needs-changes after offline discussion" \
  --overrides-disposition <older-disposition-id> \
  --replaces <older-disposition-id>

shore review disposition show --pretty
shore review disposition show --all --include-summary
```

`--replaces` is the only V1 relationship that removes an older disposition
from the current set. `--overrides-*` records authority metadata only.
`--related-observation` and `--related-intervention` record evidence links;
they do not mutate observations or close interventions (use
`shore review intervention resolve` for the intervention lifecycle).

## 5. Compatibility and import surfaces (optional)

The older review-stream surface is still useful for working with sidecar
review notes from other tools, or for a quick read-only look at the diff.

### `shore notes apply`

`shore notes apply` imports a native `review-notes.json` sidecar into durable
storage without publishing a revision.

```bash
shore notes apply --repo . --review-notes review-notes.json
```

It writes one immutable `review_note_imported` event per imported note.
Imported notes appear in `shore review unit show` as adapter notes, and in
`shore dump` and `shore show` as note rows in the review stream.

### `shore dump`

`shore dump` emits the headless review-stream JSON for the current working
tree. It is a useful integration surface for non-Shore frontends and tests.

```bash
shore dump --pretty
shore dump --review-notes review-notes.json
```

`shore dump` operates on the **working tree at run time**, not on a captured
ReviewUnit. It does not include native observations, interventions, or
dispositions — use `shore review unit show` for those.

### `shore show`

`shore show` is the read-only terminal review view over the same review
stream. It opens a split pane and supports a small set of keybindings:

```bash
shore show
shore show --review-notes review-notes.json
```

- `q` / Esc / Ctrl+C — quit
- `j` / `k` or Up / Down — move by row
- `[` / `]` — move through hunks
- `{` / `}` — move through hunks with review notes
- `r` — re-ingest the working tree and reload

Like `shore dump`, `shore show` does not yet project native observations,
interventions, or dispositions; it renders the diff, imported notes, and any
stale/orphan note rows.

## 6. Concepts you need to know

### Durable event facts vs. rebuildable projections

Shore separates **authoritative facts** from **derived views**:

- `.shore/events/` is the authoritative append-only log. Each file is one
  immutable durable fact. Events are never moved, retried in place, or
  rewritten on read.
- `.shore/artifacts/` holds the immutable support records that events bind to:
  captured ReviewUnit snapshots, and the optional content-addressed bodies
  for large observation, intervention, and disposition payloads.
- `.shore/state.json` is a **rebuildable projection**, not the authority. It
  may be deleted and regenerated; freshness against the current event set is
  verified through `eventSetHash`.

If `.shore/state.json` looks stale or inconsistent, Shore rebuilds it from
the event log. Do not write to `state.json` yourself, and do not depend on
its internal shape.

### Command-output JSON is the integration surface

The stable surface for automation is **command-output JSON documents**:
`shore.review-capture`, `shore.review-history`, `shore.review-unit`,
`shore.review-observation-add` / `-list`,
`shore.review-intervention-request` / `-list` / `-fetch` / `-resolve`,
`shore.review-disposition-add` / `-show`, and `shore.notes-apply`.

These documents expose semantic IDs, content hashes, and freshness metadata.
Raw event files, event filenames, artifact paths, and `.shore/state.json` are
Shore-owned storage details. They can change without a deprecation cycle.

### Old dump/show stream vs. ReviewUnit ledger

There are two overlapping read surfaces today:

- The **review-stream surface** (`shore dump`, `shore show`) operates on the
  working tree at run time and renders the unified diff plus imported notes.
  It is the older surface and is well-suited to import workflows and quick
  read-only viewing.
- The **ReviewUnit ledger** (`shore review capture` plus the
  `shore review observation`, `intervention`, `disposition`, `history`, and
  `unit show` commands) operates on a frozen captured snapshot plus the
  durable event log. It is the surface for recording review facts.

Native observations, interventions, and dispositions appear in
`shore review unit show` but are not yet projected into `shore dump` or
`shore show`. If you need a single view that combines a captured snapshot
with all ledger facts, use `shore review unit show`.

### Tracks

Every observation, intervention, and disposition belongs to a required
`--track`. Tracks are **review lanes**, such as `agent:codex` or
`human:kevin`. They are not actor identity. Writer provenance — who actually
ran the command, with which tool — is recorded separately in the event
envelope from local Git config and the Shore tool identity. Pick track names
that group facts the way you want to read them back, then let provenance
take care of itself.

### Bodies

Observation bodies, intervention request bodies, intervention resolution
reasons, and disposition summaries all share the same input mechanics:
`--body` / `--body-file` / `--body-stdin` (or `--summary*` /
`--reason*`). Read commands omit body-like text by default and hydrate it
only when `--include-body` is passed. Small bodies stay inline in the event
payload; larger bodies move to content-addressed artifacts. From a user
perspective, the difference is invisible — read commands return the same
shape either way.

### IDs are opaque

Shore exposes several kinds of IDs in its output: ReviewUnit IDs, revision
IDs, snapshot IDs, observation IDs, intervention IDs, intervention resolution
IDs, disposition IDs, event IDs, and review-stream row IDs. **Treat them all
as opaque strings.** They are stable and safe to use as keys or to pass back
into other commands, but their internal format is an implementation detail.
In particular:

- Do not parse review-stream `row.id` values, derive ordering from them
  lexically, or assume any particular width or prefix. Use the sibling
  `ordinal` field if you need a numeric position.
- Do not parse storage filenames. Event filenames, snapshot artifact
  filenames, and note-body artifact filenames are derived from internal
  hashes and may change without a deprecation cycle.
- Do not depend on artifact paths or the internal shape of
  `.shore/state.json`.

## 7. A small realistic walkthrough

The block below captures the typical sequence: confirm the change, capture
the ReviewUnit, inspect it, record a couple of observations, raise an
intervention, resolve it, and land a disposition.

```bash
# 0. Confirm the worktree has the changes you want to review.
cd ~/src/myproject
git status

# 1. Capture a ReviewUnit. This freezes the current diff as a snapshot.
#    `shore review capture` emits compact JSON only; pipe through jq if you
#    want to read it.
shore review capture | jq .

# 2. Read the captured ReviewUnit (composite view, narrative + snapshot).
shore review unit show --pretty | less

# 3. Record observations as you read the diff.
shore review observation add \
  --track agent:codex \
  --title "Check error handling near IO boundary" \
  --file src/io.rs --start-line 88 --end-line 104 \
  --body "The new branch swallows io::ErrorKind::Interrupted silently."

shore review observation add \
  --track human:kevin \
  --title "Unit test for the new retry path" \
  --file src/io.rs --start-line 120 --end-line 135

shore review observation list --pretty

# 4. Raise an intervention when you need a decision from someone else.
shore review intervention request \
  --track human:kevin \
  --title "Approve schema migration before landing" \
  --reason manual-decision-required \
  --file db/migrations/0042_users.sql

# Someone reads the open queue and resolves it.
shore review intervention list --status open
shore review intervention resolve <intervention-id> \
  --outcome approved \
  --reason "verified backfill plan with on-call DBA"

# 5. Record the final disposition for the ReviewUnit.
shore review disposition add \
  --track human:kevin \
  --disposition accepted-with-follow-up \
  --summary "ship it; follow up on the retry-path unit test"

# 6. Verify the durable record.
shore review disposition show --pretty
shore review history --pretty | less
```

That is the full V1 workflow. Anything beyond it — notifications, daemons,
multi-writer coordination, automatic delivery — is intentionally out of
scope and will be addressed by future, separately-designed subsystems.
